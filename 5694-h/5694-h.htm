    <h2>
      BOOK I. THE VICTIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in a little woodland glen, with a streamlet tumbling through it.
      She sat with her back to a snowy birch-tree, gazing into the eddies of a
      pool below; and he lay beside her, upon the soft, mossy ground, reading
      out of a book of poems. Images of joy were passing before them; and there
      came four lines with a picture&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Hard by, a cottage-chimney smokes,
    From betwixt two aged oaks,
    Where Corydon and Thyrsis, met,
    Are at their savory dinner set."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said she. "I always loved that. Let us be Corydon and Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. "They were both of them men," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us change it," she responded&mdash;"just between ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well&mdash;Corydon!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment's thought, she added, "But we didn't have the
      cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he&mdash;"nor even the dinner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1. It was the Highway of Lost Men. They shivered, and drew their
      shoulders together as they walked, for it was night, and a cold, sleety
      rain was falling. The lights from saloons and pawn-shops fell upon their
      faces&mdash;faces haggard and gaunt with misery, or bloated with disease
      and sin. Some stared before them fixedly; some gazed about with furtive
      and hungry eyes as they shuffled on. Here and there a policeman stood in
      the shelter, swinging his club and watching them as they passed. Music
      called to them from dives and dance-halls, and lighted signs and
      flaring-colored pictures tempted them in the entrances of cheap museums
      and theatres; they lingered before these, glad of even a moment's shelter.
      Overhead the elevated trains pounded by; and from the windows one could
      see men crowded about the stoves in the rooms of lodging-houses, where the
      steam from their garments made a blur in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down this highway walked a lad, about fifteen years of age, pale of face,
      and with delicate and sensitive features. His overcoat was buttoned
      tightly about his neck, and his hands thrust into his pockets; he gazed
      around him swiftly as he walked. He came to this place every now and then,
      but he never grew used to what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyed the men who passed him; and when he came to a saloon he would push
      open the door and gaze about. Sometimes he would enter, and hurry through,
      to peer into the compartments in the back; and then go out again, giving a
      wide berth to the drinkers, and shrinking from their glances. Once a girl
      appeared in a doorway, and smiled and nodded to him; he started and
      hurried out, shuddering. Her wanton black eyes haunted him, hinting
      unimaginable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on a corner, he stopped and spoke to a policeman. "Hello!" said the
      man, and shook his head&mdash;"No, not this time." So the boy went on;
      there were several miles of this Highway, and each block of it the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in a dingy bar-room, with saw-dust strewn upon the floor, and the
      odor of stale beer and tobacco-smoke in the air&mdash;here suddenly the
      boy sprang forward, with a cry: "Father!" And a man who sat with bowed
      head in a corner gave a start, and lifted a white face and stared at him.
      He rose unsteadily to his feet, and staggered to the other, and fell upon
      his shoulder, sobbing, "My son! My son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How many times had Thyrsis heard those words&mdash;in how many hours of
      anguish! They sank into the deeps of him, waking echoes like the clang of
      a bell: they voiced all the terror and grief of defeated life&mdash;"My
      son! My son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man clung to him, weeping, and pouring out the flood of his shame. "I
      have fallen again&mdash;I am lost&mdash;I am lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupants of the place were watching the scene with dull curiosity;
      and the boy was trembling like a wild deer trapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father, yes! Let us go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home&mdash;home, my son? Will you take me home? Oh, I couldn't bear to
      go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must come home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you still love me, son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father, I still love you. I want to try to help you. Come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the boy would gaze about and ask, "Where is your hat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hat, my son? I don't know. I have lost it." The boy would see his torn
      and mud-stained clothing, and the poor old pitiful face, with the eyes
      blood-shot and swollen, and the skin, that had been rosy, and was now a
      ghastly, ashen gray. He would choke back his feelings, and grip his hands
      to keep himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, father, take my hat, and let us go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my son. I don't need any hat. Nothing can hurt me&mdash;I am lost!
      Lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So they would go out, arm in arm; and while they made their progress up
      the Highway, the man would pour out his remorse, and tell the story of his
      weeks of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a mile or so, he would halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must stop here, son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have something to drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>No</i>, father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my boy, I can't go on! I can't walk! You don't know what I'm
      suffering!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got the money left&mdash;I'm not asking you. I'll come right with
      you&mdash;on my word of honor I will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they would fight it out&mdash;all the way back to the lodging-house
      where they lived, and where the mother sat and wept. And here they would
      put him to bed, and lock up his clothing to keep him in; and here, with
      drugs and mineral-waters, and perhaps a doctor to help, they would
      struggle with him, and tend him until he was on his feet again. Then, with
      clothing newly-brushed and face newly-shaven he would go back to the world
      of men; and the boy would go back to his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Such was the life of Thyrsis, from earliest childhood to
      maturity. His father's was a heritage of gentle breeding and high
      traditions&mdash;his forefathers were cavaliers, and had served the State.
      And now it had come to this&mdash;to hall bedrooms in lodging-houses, and
      a life-and-death grapple with destruction! And when Thyrsis came to study
      the problem, he found that it was a struggle without hope; his father was
      a man in a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was what people called a "drummer". He was dependent for his living
      upon the favor of certain merchants&mdash;men for the most part of low
      ideals, who came to the city in search of their low pleasures. One met
      them by waiting about in the lobbies of hotels, and in the bar-rooms which
      they frequented; and always the first sign of fellowship with them was to
      have a drink. And this was the field on which the battle had to be fought!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would hold out for months&mdash;half a year, perhaps&mdash;drinking
      lemonade and putting up with their raillery. And then he would begin with
      ginger-ale; and then it would come to beer; and then to whiskey. He was
      always devising new plans to control himself; always persuading himself
      that he had solved the problem. He would not drink in the morning; he
      would not drink until after dinner; he would not drink alone&mdash;and so
      on without end. His whole life was drink, and all his thoughts were of
      drink&mdash;the odor of it always in his nostrils, the image of it always
      before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the grimness of his fate lay here&mdash;that it was by his best
      qualities that he was betrayed. If he had been hard and mercenary, like
      some of those who preyed upon him, there might have been hope. But he was
      generous and free-hearted, a slave to his impulses of friendship. And this
      was what made the struggle such a cruel one to Thyrsis; it was like the
      sight of some noble animal basely snared.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his earliest days the boy had watched these forces working themselves
      out. The gentleman and the "drummer" fought for supremacy, and step by
      step the soul of the man was fashioned to the work he did. To succeed with
      his customers he must share their ideas and their tastes; and so he was
      bitter against reformers, who interfered with the gaieties of the city,
      with no consideration for the tastes of "buyers." But then, on the other
      hand, would come a time of renunciation, when he would be all enthusiasm
      for temperance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of old-fashioned ideas, which would take the quaintest turns
      of reactionism; his politics were summed up in the phrase that he "would
      rather vote for a nigger than a Republican"; but then, in the same breath,
      he would announce some fine and noble sentiment, out of the traditions of
      a forgotten past. He was the soul of courtesy to women, and of loyalty to
      friends. He worshipped General Lee and the old time "Virginia gentleman";
      and those with whom he lived, and for whose unclean profits he sold
      himself, never guessed the depths of his contempt for all they stood for.
      They had the dollars, they were on top; but some day the nemesis of
      Good-breeding would smite them&mdash;the army of the ghosts of Gentility
      would rise, and with "Marse Robert" and "Jeb" Stuart at their head, would
      sweep away the hordes of commercialdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis saw a great deal of this forgotten chivalry. His nursery had been
      haunted by such musty phantoms; and when he first came to the Northern
      city, he stayed at a hotel which was frequented by people who lived in
      this past&mdash;old ladies who were proud and prim, and old gentlemen who
      were quixotic and humorous, young ladies who were "belles," and young
      gentlemen who aspired to be "blades". It was a world that would have made
      happy the soul of any writer of romances; but to Thyrsis in earliest
      childhood the fates had given the gift of seeing beneath the shams of
      things, and to him this dead Aristocracy cried out loudly for burial.
      There was an incredible amount of drunkenness, and of debauchery scarcely
      hidden; there was pretense strutting like a peacock, and avarice skulking
      like a hound; there were jealousy, and base snobbery, and raging spite,
      and a breath of suspicion and scandal hanging like a poisonous cloud over
      everything. These people came and went, an endless procession of them;
      they laughed and danced and gossiped and drank their way through the boy's
      life, and unconsciously he judged them, and hated them and feared them. It
      was not by such that his destiny was to be shaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of them were poor; not an honest poverty, but a sham and artificial
      poverty&mdash;the inability to dress as others did, and to lose money at
      "bridge" and "poker", and to pay the costs of their self-indulgences. As
      for Thyrsis and his parents, they always paid what they owed; but they
      were not always able to pay it when they owed it, and they suffered all
      the agonies and humiliations of those who did not pay at all. There was
      scarcely ever a week when this canker of want did not gnaw at them; their
      life was one endless and sordid struggle to make last year's clothing look
      like new, and to find some boarding-house that was cheaper and yet
      respectable. There was endless wrangling and strife and worry over money;
      and every year the task was harder, the standards lower, the case more
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were rich relatives, a world of real luxury up above&mdash;the thing
      that called itself "Society". And Thyrsis was a student and a bright lad,
      and he was welcome there; he might have spread his wings and flown away
      from this sordidness. But duty held him, and love and memory held him
      still tighter. For his father worshipped him, and craved his help; to the
      last hour of his dreadful battle, he fought to keep his son's regard&mdash;he
      prayed for it, with tears in his eyes and anguish in his voice. And so the
      boy had to stand by. And that meant that he grew up in a torture-house, he
      drank a cup of poison to its bitter dregs. To others his father was merely
      a gross little man, with sordid ideas and low tastes; but to Thyrsis he
      was a man with the terror of the hunted creatures in his soul, and the
      furies of madness cracking their whips about his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one ending possible&mdash;it worked itself out with the
      remorseless precision of a machine. The soul that fought was smothered and
      stifled, its voice grew fainter and feebler; the agony and the shame grew
      hotter, the suffering more cruel, the despair more black. Until at last
      they found him in a delirium, and took him to a private hospital; and
      thither went Thyrsis, now grown to be a man, and sat in a dingy
      reception-room, and a dingy doctor came to him and said, "Do you wish to
      see the body?" And Thyrsis answered, in a low voice, "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. So it was that the soul of this lad had grown sombre, and taken
      to brooding upon the mysteries of fate. Life was no jest and no holiday,
      it was no place for shams and self-deceptions. It was a place where cruel
      enemies set traps for the unwary; a field where blind and merciless forces
      ranged, unhindered by man or God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis could not have told how soon in life this sense had come to him.
      In his earliest childhood he had known that his father was preyed upon,
      just as certainly as any wild thing in the forest. At first the enemies
      had been saloon-keepers, and wicked men who tempted him to drink with
      them. The names of these men were household words to him, portents of
      terror; they peopled his imagination as epic figures, such as Black
      Douglas must have been to the children of the Northern Border.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, with widening intelligence, it became certain social forces, at
      first dimly apprehended. It was the god of "business"&mdash;before which
      all things fair and noble went down. It was "business" that kept vice
      triumphant in the city; it was because of "business" that the saloons
      could not be closed even on Sunday, so that the father might be at home
      one day in seven. And was it not in search of "business" that he was
      driven forth to loaf in hotel-lobbies and bar-rooms?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was to blame for this, Thyrsis did not know; but certain men made
      profit of it&mdash;and these, too, were ignoble men. He knew this; for now
      and then his father's employers would honor the little family with some
      kind of an invitation, and they would have to swallow their pride and go.
      So Thyrsis grew up, with the sense of a great evil loose in the world; a
      wrong, of which the world did not know. And within him grew a passionate
      longing to cry aloud to others, to open their eyes to this truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly he was like other boys, eager and cheerful, even boisterous; but
      within was this hidden thing, which brooded and questioned. Life had made
      him into an ascetic. He must be stern, even merciless, with himself&mdash;because
      of the fear that was in him, and in his mother as well. The fear that
      self-indulgence might lay its grisly paws upon him! The fear that he, too,
      might fall into the trap!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not merely that he never touched stimulants; he had an instinct
      against all things that were softening and enervating, all things that
      tempted and enslaved. For him was the morning-air, and the shock of cold
      water, and the hardness of the wild things of the open. Other people did
      not feel this way; other people pampered themselves and defiled themselves&mdash;and
      so Thyrsis went apart. He lived quite alone with his thoughts, he had
      never a chum, scarcely even any friends. Where in the long procession of
      lodging and boarding-houses and summer-resorts should he meet people who
      knew what he knew about life? Where in all the world should he meet them,
      save in the books of great men in times past?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much of what is called "culture" in his family; no music at
      all, and no poetry. But there were novels, and there were libraries where
      one could get more of these, so Thyrsis became a devourer of stories; he
      would disappear, and they would find him at meal-times, hidden in a clump
      of bushes, or in a corner behind a sofa&mdash;anywhere out of the world.
      He read whole libraries of adventure: Mayne-Reid and Henty, and then
      Cooper and Stevenson and Scott. And then came more serious novels&mdash;"Don
      Quixote" and "Les Misérables," George Eliot, whom he loved, and Dickens,
      whose social protest thrilled him; and chiefest of all Thackeray, who
      moulded his thought. Thackeray knew the world that he knew, Thackeray saw
      to the heart of it; and no high-souled lad who had read him and worshipped
      him was ever after to be lured by the glamor of the "great" world&mdash;a
      world whose greatness was based upon selfishness and greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis knew no foreign language, and fate or instinct kept him from those
      writers who jested with uncleanness; so he was virginal, and pure in all
      his imaginings. Other lads exchanged confidences in forbidden things, they
      broke down the barriers and tore away the veils; but Thyrsis had never
      breathed a word about matters of sex to any living creature. He pondered
      and guessed, but no one knew his thoughts; and this was a crucial thing,
      the secret of much of his aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. In one of the early boarding-houses there had been a little girl,
      and the families had become intimate. But the two children disliked each
      other, and kept apart all they could. Thyrsis was domineering and
      imperious, and things must always be his way. He was given to rebellion,
      whereas Corydon was gentle and meek, and submitted to confinements and
      prohibitions in a quite disgraceful manner. She was a pretty little girl,
      with great black eyes; and because she was silent and shy, he set her down
      as "stupid", and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent a summer in the country together, where Thyrsis possessed
      himself of a sling-shot, and took to collecting the skins of squirrels and
      chipmunks. Corydon was horrified at this; and by way of helping her to
      overcome her squeamishness he would make her carry home the bleeding
      corpses. He took to raising, young birds, also, and soon had quite an
      aviary&mdash;two robins, and a crow, and a survivor from a brood of
      "cherry-birds." The feeding of these nestlings was no small task, but
      Thyrsis went fishing when the spirit moved him, secure in the certainty
      that the calls of the hungry creatures would keep Corydon at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the way of it, until Corydon began to blossom into a young lady,
      beautiful and tenderly-fashioned. Thyrsis still saw her now and then, and
      he made attempts to share his higher joys with her. He had become a lover
      of poetry; once they walked by the seashore, and he read her "Alexander's
      Feast", thrilling with delight in its resounding phrases:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Break his bands of sleep asunder,
    And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder!"
</pre>
    <p>
      But Corydon had never heard of Timotheus, and she had not been taught to
      exploit her emotions. She could only say that she did not understand it
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, on another occasion, Thyrsis endeavored to tell her about
      Berkeley, whom he had been reading. But Corydon did not take to the
      sensational philosophy either; she would come back again and again to the
      evasion of old Dr. Johnson&mdash;"When I kick a stone, I know the stone is
      there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl was like a beautiful flower, Thyrsis told himself&mdash;like all
      the flowers that had gone before her, and all those that would come after,
      from generation to generation. She fitted so perfectly into her
      environment, she grew so calmly and serenely; she wore pretty dresses, and
      helped to serve tea, and was graceful and sweet&mdash;and with never an
      idea that there was anything in life beyond these things. So Thyrsis
      pondered as he went his way, complacent over his own perspicacity; and got
      not even a whiff of smoke from the volcano of rebellion and misery that
      was seething deep down in her soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      The choosers of the unborn souls had played a strange fantasy here; they
      had stolen one of the daughters of ancient Greece, and set her down in
      this metropolis of commercialdom. For Corydon might have been Nausikaa
      herself; she might have marched in the Panathenaic procession, with one of
      the sacred vessels in her hands; she might have run in the Attic games,
      bare-limbed and fearless. Hers was a soul that leaped to the call of joy,
      that thrilled at the faintest touch of beauty. Above all else, she was
      born for music&mdash;she could have sung so that the world would have
      remembered it. And she was pent in a dingy boarding-house, with no point
      of contact with anything about her&mdash;with no human soul to whom she
      could whisper her despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      They sent her to a public-school, where the sad-eyed drudges of the
      traders came to be drilled for their tasks. They harrowed her with
      arithmetic and grammar, which she abhorred; they taught her patriotic
      songs, about a country to which she did not belong. And also, they sent
      her to Sunday-school, which was worse yet. She had the strangest,
      instinctive hatred of their religion, with all that it stood for. The
      sight of a clergyman with his vestments and his benedictions would make
      her fairly bristle with hostility. They talked to her about her sins, and
      she did not know what they meant; they pried into the state of her soul,
      and she shrunk from them as if they had been hairy spiders. Here, too,
      they taught her to sing&mdash;droning hymns that were a mockery of all the
      joys of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Corydon devoured her own heart in secret; and in time a dreadful thing
      came to happen&mdash;the stagnant soul beginning to fester. One day the
      girl, whose heart was the quintessence of all innocence, happened to see a
      low word scribbled upon a fence. And now&mdash;they had urged her to
      discover sins, and she discovered them. Suppose that word were to stay in
      her mind and haunt her&mdash;suppose that she were not able to forget it,
      try as she would! And of course she tried; and the more she tried, the
      less she succeeded; and so came the discovery that she was a lost soul and
      a creature of depravity! The thought occurred to her, that she might go on
      to think of other words, and to think of images and actions as well; she
      might be unable to forget any of them&mdash;her mind might become a
      storehouse of such horrors! And so the maiden out of ancient Greece would
      lie awake all night and wrestle with fiends, until she was bathed in a
      perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. About this time Thyrsis was making his <i>début</i> as an author.
      He had discovered a curious knack in himself, a turn for making verses of
      a sort which were pleasing to children. They came from some little corner
      of his consciousness, he scarcely knew how; but there was a paper that was
      willing to buy them, and to pay him the princely sum of five dollars a
      week! This would pay for his food and his hall bedroom, or for board at
      some farm in the summer; and so for several years Thyrsis was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told a falsehood about his age, and entered college, and buried himself
      up to the eyes in work. This was a college in a city, and a poor college,
      where the students all lived at home, and had nothing to do but study; and
      so Thyrsis missed all that beneficent illumination known as
      "student-life." He never hurrahed at foot-ball contests, nor did he dress
      himself in honorific garments, nor stupify himself at "smokers." Being
      democratic, and without thought of setting himself up over others, he was
      unaware of his greatest opportunities, and when they invited him into a
      fraternity, he declined. Once or twice he found himself roaming the
      streets at night with a crowd of students, emitting barbaric screechings;
      but this made him feel silly, and so he lagged behind and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college served its purpose, in introducing him to the world of
      knowledge; but that did not take long, and afterwards it was all in his
      way. The mathematics were a discipline, and in them he rejoiced as a
      strong man to run a race; and this was true also of the sciences, and of
      history&mdash;the only trouble was that he would finish the text-books in
      the first few weeks, and after that there was nothing to do save to
      compose verses in class, and to make sketches of the professors. But as
      for the "languages" and the "literatures" they taught him&mdash;in the end
      Thyrsis came to forgive them, because he saw that they did not know what
      languages and literatures were. On this account he took to begging leave
      of absence on grounds of his poverty; and then he would go home and spend
      his days and nights in learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One could get so much for so little, in this wonderful world of mind! For
      eight cents he picked up a paper volume of Emerson's "Essays"; and in this
      shrewd and practical nobility was so much that he was seeking in life! And
      then he stumbled upon a fifteen-cent edition of "Sartor Resartus", and
      took that home and read it. It was like the clash of trumpets and cymbals
      to him; it made his whole being leap. Hour after hour he read, breathless,
      like a man bewitched, the whole night through. He would cry aloud with
      delight, or drop the book and pound his knee and laugh over the demoniac
      power of it. The next day he began the "French Revolution"; and after
      that, alas, he found there was no more&mdash;for Carlyle had turned his
      back upon democracy, and so Thyrsis turned his back upon Carlyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this was one of the forces which had had to do with the shaping of his
      thought. Beginning in the public-schools he had learned about his country&mdash;the
      country which was his, if not Corydon's. He had read in its history&mdash;Irving's
      "Life of Washington," and ten great volumes about Lincoln; so he had come
      to understand that salvation is of the people, and that those things which
      the people do not do&mdash;those things have not yet been done. So no one
      could deceive him, or lead him astray; he might laugh with the Tories, and
      even love them for their foibles&mdash;quaint old Samuel Johnson, for
      instance, because he was poor and sturdy, and had stood by his trade of
      bookman; but at bottom Thyrsis knew that all these men were gilding a
      corpse. Wordsworth and Tennyson, Browning and Swinburne&mdash;he followed
      each one as far as their revolutionary impulse lasted; and after that
      there was no more in them for him. Even Ruskin, who taught him the
      possibilities of English prose, and opened his eyes to the form and color
      of the world of nature&mdash;even Ruskin he gave up, because he was a
      philanthropist and not a democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had been brought up as a devout Episcopalian. They had dressed him
      in scarlet and white to carry the train of the bishop at confirmation, and
      had sent him to an afternoon service every day throughout Lent. Early in
      life he had stumbled on a paper copy of Paine's "Age of Reason," and he
      read it with horror, and then conducted a private <i>auto da fé</i>. But
      the questions of the book stayed with him, and as years passed they
      clamored more loudly. What would have happened, astronomically, if the sun
      had stood still? And how many different species would have had to go into
      the ark? And what was the size of a whale's gullet, and the probable
      digestive powers of a whale's stomach?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came more fundamental difficulties. Could there, after all, be
      such a duty as faith in any intellectual matter? Could there be any
      revelation superior to reason&mdash;must not reason have once decided that
      it was a revelation, or was not? And what of all the other "revelations",
      which all the other peoples of the world accepted? And then again, if
      Jesus had been God, could he really have been tempted? To be God and man
      at the same time&mdash;did that not mean both to know and not to know? And
      was there any way conceivable for anything to be God, in which everything
      else was not God?
    </p>
    <p>
      These perplexities and many others the boy took to his clerical adviser, a
      man who loved him dearly, and who gave him some volumes of the "Bampton
      lectures" to read. Here was the defense of Christianity, conducted by
      authorities, and with scholarship and dignity; and Thyrsis found to his
      dismay that the only convincing parts of their books were where they gave
      a <i>résumé</i> of the arguments of their opponents. He learned in this
      way many difficulties that had not yet occurred to him; and when he had
      got through with the reading his mind was made up. If any man were to be
      damned for not believing such things, then it was his duty as a thinker to
      be damned; and so he bade farewell to the Church&mdash;something which was
      sad, in a way, for his mother had been planning him for a bishop!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. But Thyrsis was throwing away many chances these days. He went
      into the higher regions to spend his Christmas holidays; and instead of
      being tactful and agreeable, he buried himself in a corner of the library
      all day long. For Thyrsis had made the greatest discovery yet&mdash;he had
      found out Shakespeare! At school they had taught him "English" by means of
      "to be or not to be", and they had sought to trap him at examinations by
      means of "man's first disobedience and the fruit"; and so for years they
      had held him back from the two great glories of our literature. But now,
      by accident, he stumbled into "The Tempest"; and after that he read every
      line of the plays in two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his soul in that wonderland; he walked and thought no more like
      the men of earth&mdash;he dwelt with those lords and princes of the soul,
      and learned to speak their language. He would dodge among cable-cars and
      trucks with their heavenly melodies in his ears; and while he sung them
      his eyes flashed and his heart beat fast:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"
</pre>
    <p>
      There were a few days left in those wondrous holidays; and these went to
      Milton. There was a set of his works, enormously expensive, which had been
      made and purchased with no idea that any human being would ever read them.
      But Thyrsis read them, and so all the beauty of the binding was justified.
      For hours, and hours upon hours, he drank in that thunderous music, crying
      it aloud with his hands clenched tightly, and stopping to laugh like a
      child with excitement:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Th'imperial ensign, which full high advanced,
    Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,
    With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,
    Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while
    Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And afterwards, when he came to the palace that "rose like an exhalation",
      all of Thyrsis' soul rose with it. One summer's day he stood on a high
      mountain with a railroad in the valley, and saw a great freight-engine
      stop still and pour out its masses of dense black smoke. It rose in the
      breathless air, straight as a column, high and majestic; and Thyrsis
      thought of that line. It carried him out into the heavens, and he knew
      that a flash of poetry such as that is the meeting of man's groping hand
      with God's.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about here that a strange adventure came to him. It was midwinter,
      and he went out, long after midnight, to walk in a beautiful garden. A dry
      powdery snow crunched beneath his feet, and overhead the stars gleamed and
      quivered, so bright that he felt like stretching out his hands to them.
      The world lay still, and awful in its beauty; and here suddenly,
      unsuspected&mdash;unheralded, and quite unsought&mdash;there came to
      Thyrsis a strange and portentous experience, the first of his ecstasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not have told whether he walked or sat down, whether he spoke or
      was silent; he lost all sense of his own existence&mdash;his consciousness
      was given up to the people of his dreams, the companions and lovers of his
      fancy. The cold and snow were gone, and there was a moonlit glade in a
      forest; and thither they came, one by one, friendly and human, yet in the
      full panoply of their splendor and grace. There were Shelley and Milton,
      and the gentle and troubled Hamlet, and the sorrowful knight of la Mancha,
      with the irrepressible Falstaff to hearten them all; a strangely-assorted
      company, yet royal spirits all of them, and no strangers to each other in
      their own world. And here they gathered and conversed, each in his own
      vein and from his own impulse, with gracious fancy and lofty vision and
      heart-easing mirth. And ah, how many miles would one have travelled to be
      with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the burden which this gift laid upon Thyrsis. He soon discovered
      that these visions of wonder came but once, and that when they were gone,
      they were gone forever. And he must learn to grapple with them as they
      fled, to labor with them and to hold them fast, at the cost of whatever
      heartbreaking strain. Thus alone could men have even the feeblest
      reflexion of their beauty&mdash;upon which to feed their souls forever
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. These things came at the same time as another development in
      Thyrsis' life, likewise portentous and unexpected. Boyhood was gone, and
      manhood had come. There was a bodily change taking place in him&mdash;he
      became aware of it with a start, and with the strangest and most
      uncomfortable thrills. He did not know what to make of it, or what to do
      about it; nor did he know where to turn for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to put it aside, as a thing of no importance. But it would not be
      put aside&mdash;it was of vast importance. He discovered new desires in
      himself, impulses that dominated him in a most disturbing way. He found
      that he took a new interest in women and young girls; he wanted to linger
      near them, and their glances caused him strange emotions. He resented
      this, as an invasion of his privacy; it was inconsistent with his
      hermit-instinct. Thyrsis wished no women in his life save the muses with
      their star-sewn garments. He had been fond of a line from a sonnet to
      Milton:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart."
</pre>
    <p>
      But instead of this, what awful humiliations! In a summer-resort where he
      found himself, there was a girl of not very gentle breeding, somewhat
      pudgy and with a languishing air. She liked to have boys snuggle down by
      her; and so Thyrsis spent the whole of one evening, sitting in a
      summer-house with an arm about her waist, dissolved in a sort of moon-calf
      sentimentalism. And then he passed the rest of the night wandering about
      in the forest cursing himself, with tears of shame and vexation in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so ignorant about these matters that he did not even know if the
      changes that had taken place in him were normal, or whether they were
      doing him harm. He made up his mind that he must have advice; as it was
      unthinkable that he should speak about such shameful things with any grown
      person, he bethought himself of a classmate in college who was an earnest
      and sober man. This friend, much older than Thyrsis, was the son of an
      evangelical clergyman, and was headed for the ministry himself. His name
      was Warner, and Thyrsis had helped him in arranging for some religious
      meetings at the college. Warner had been shocked by his theological
      irregularities; but they were still friends, and now Thyrsis sought a
      chance to exchange confidences with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity came while they were strolling down an avenue near the
      college, and a woman passed them, a woman with bold and hard features, and
      obviously-painted cheeks. She smiled at a group of students just ahead,
      and one of them turned and walked off arm in arm with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" exclaimed Warner. "Did you see that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis. "Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She comes from a house just around the corner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;she's a street-walker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A street-walker!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought to Thyrsis' mind a problem that had been haunting him for a
      year or two. Always when he walked about the streets at night there were
      women who smiled at him and whispered. And he knew that these were bad
      women, and shrunk from them. But just what did they mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does she do?" he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, don't you know what a street-walker is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very well," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some time for him to get the desired information, because the
      other could not realize the depths of his ignorance. "They sell themselves
      to men," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what for?" asked Thyrsis. "You don't mean that they&mdash;they let
      them&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have intercourse together. Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was almost dumb with dismay. "But I should think they would have
      children!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord, man!" laughed the other. "Where do you keep yourself, anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thyrsis was too much shaken to think of being ashamed. This was a most
      appalling revelation to him&mdash;it opened quite a new vista of life's
      possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should they do such things?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They earn their living that way," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why <i>that</i> way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. They are that kind of women, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Warner went on to expound to him the facts of prostitution, and all
      the abysses of human depravity that lie thereabouts. And incidentally the
      boy got a chance to ask his questions, and to get a common-sense view of
      his perplexities. Also he got some understanding of human nature, and of
      the world in which he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was Warner, a man of twenty-four, and of a devout, if somewhat dull
      and plodding conscientiousness; and the last eight or nine years of his'
      life had been one torment because of the cravings of lust. He had never
      committed an act of unchastity&mdash;or at least he told Thyrsis that he
      had not. But he was never free from the impulse, and he had no conception
      of the possibility of being free. His desire was a purely brute one&mdash;untouched
      by any intellectual or spiritual, or even any sentimental color. He
      desired woman, as woman&mdash;it mattered not what woman. How low his
      impulses took him Thyrsis realized with a shudder from one remark that he
      made&mdash;that his poverty did not help him to live virtuously, for about
      the docks and in the workingmen's quarters there were women who would sell
      themselves for fifty cents a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man's whole life was determined by that craving; in fact it seemed to
      Thyrsis that his God had made the universe with relation to it&mdash;a
      heaven to reward him if he abstained, and a hell to punish him if he
      yielded. It was because of this that he clung to the church, and shrunk
      from any dallying with "rationalism". He disapproved of the theatre,
      because it appealed to these cravings; he disapproved of all pictures and
      statues of the nude human form, because the sight of them overmastered
      him. For the same reason he shrunk from all impassioned poetry, and from
      dancing, and even from non-religious music. He was rigid in his
      conformance to all the social conventions, because they served the purpose
      of saving him and his young women-friends from temptation; and he looked
      forward to the completion of a divinity-course as his goal, because then
      he would be able to settle down and marry, and so at last to gratify his
      desires. He stated this quite baldly, quoting the authority of St. Paul,
      that it was "better to marry than to burn."
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation brought Thyrsis to a realization that there was a great
      deal in the world that was not found in the poetry of Tennyson and
      Longfellow; and so he began to pry into the souls of others of his
      fellow-students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Warner had given him the religious attitude; and now he went
      after the scientific. There was a tall, eager-faced young man, who
      proclaimed himself a disciple of Haeckel and Herbert Spencer, and even
      went so far as to quote Schopenhauer in class. Walking home together one
      day, these two fell to arguing the freedom of the will, and the nature of
      motives and desires, and what power one has over them; and so Thyrsis made
      the startling discovery that this young man, having accepted the doctrine
      of "determinism," had drawn therefrom the corollary that he had to do what
      he wanted to do, and so was powerless to resist his sex-impulses. For the
      past year this youth, a fine, intellectual and honest student, had gone at
      regular intervals to visit a prostitute; and with entirely scientific and
      cold-blooded precision he outlined to Thyrsis the means he took to avoid
      contracting disease. Thyrsis listened, feeling as he might have felt in a
      slaughter-house; and when, returning to the deterministic hypothesis, he
      asked how it was that he had managed to escape this "necessity", he was
      told that it must be because he was of a weaker and less manly
      constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was yet another type: a man with whom there was no difficulty in
      bringing up the subject, for the reason that he was always bringing it up
      himself. Thyrsis sat next to him in a class in Latin, and noticed that
      whenever the text contained any hint at matters of sex&mdash;which was not
      infrequent in Juvenal and Horace&mdash;this man would look at him with a
      grin and a sly wink. And sometimes Thyrsis would make a casual remark in
      conversation, and the man would twist it out of its meaning, or make a pun
      out of it&mdash;to find some excuse for his satyr's leer. So at last
      Thyrsis was moved to say to him&mdash;"Don't you ever realize what a state
      you've got your mind into?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, everything in the world seems to suggest obscenity to you. You're
      always looking for it and always finding it&mdash;you don't seem to care
      about anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was interested in that view of it, and he acknowledged with mild
      amusement that it was true; apparently it was a novelty to him to discuss
      such matters seriously. He told Thyrsis that he could not remember having
      ever restrained a sexual impulse in his life. He thought of lust in
      connection with every woman he met, and his mind was a storehouse of smut.
      And yet he was not a bad fellow, in other ways; he handsome, and a good
      deal of an athlete, and was planning to be a physician. "You'll find most
      all the fellows are the same," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this, Thyrsis was selected to represent his college on a
      debating-team, and he went away to another city and was invited to a
      fraternity-house; and here, suddenly, he discovered how much of
      "college-life" he had been missing. This was a fashionable university, and
      he met the sons of wealthy parents. About a score of them lived in this
      fraternity-house, without any sort of supervision or restraint. They ate
      in a beautiful oak-panelled dining-room adorned with drinking-steins; and
      throughout the meal they treated their visitor to such an orgy of
      obscenity as he had never dreamed of in his life before. Thyrsis was
      trapped and could not get away; and it seemed to him when he rose from the
      table that there was nothing left clean in all God's universe. These boys
      appeared to vie with each other in blasphemous abandonment; and it was not
      simply wantonness&mdash;it was sprawling and disgusting filthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of this group took Thyrsis driving, and was led to talk. Here was a
      youth whose father was the president of a great manufacturing-enterprise,
      and supplied him with unlimited funds; which money the boy used to divert
      himself in the pursuit of young women. Sometimes he had stooped so low as
      manicure-girls and shop-clerks and stenographers; but for the most part he
      sought actresses and chorus-girls&mdash;they had more intelligence and
      spirit, he explained, they were harder to win. He had his way with them,
      partly because he was handsome and clever, but mainly because he was the
      keeper of the keys of opportunity. It was his to dispense auto-rides and
      champagne-suppers, and flowers and jewels, and all things else that were
      desirable in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was appalled at the hardness and the utter ruthlessness of this
      man&mdash;he saw him as a young savage turned loose to prey in a civilized
      community. He had the most supreme contempt for his victims&mdash;that was
      what they were made for, and he paid them their price. Nor was this just
      because they were women, it was a matter of class; the young man had a
      mother and sisters, to whom he applied quite other standards. But Thyrsis
      found himself wondering how long, with this contagion raging among the
      fathers and the sons, it would be possible to keep the mothers and the
      daughters sterilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. These discoveries came one by one; but Thyrsis saw enough at the
      outset to make it clear that the time had come for him to gird up his
      loins. The choice of Hercules was before him; and he did not intend that
      the course of his life was to be decided by these cravings of the animal
      within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the grosser sorts of temptation he was always saved by the
      fastidiousness of his temperament; the thought of a woman who sold herself
      for money could never bring him anything but shuddering. But all about his
      lodging-house lived the daughters of the poor, and these were a snare for
      his feet. It seemed to him as if this craving came to a man in regular
      pulses; he could go for weeks, serene and happy in his work&mdash;and then
      suddenly would come the restlessness, and he would go out into the night
      and wander about the streets for hours, impelled by a futile yearning for
      he knew not what&mdash;the hope of something clean in the midst of
      uncleanliness, of some adventure that would be not quite shameful to a
      poet's fancy. And then, after midnight, he would steal home, baffled and
      sick at heart, and wet his pillow with hot and bitter tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      So unbearable to him was the thought of such perils that he was impelled
      to seek his old friend the clergyman, who had lost him over the ancient Hebrew
      mythologies, and now won him back by his living moral force. With much
      embarrassment and stammering Thyrsis managed to give a hint of what
      troubled him; and the man, whose life was made wholly of love for others,
      opened his great heart and took Thyrsis in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told him of his own youthful struggle&mdash;a struggle which had
      resulted in victory, for he had never known a woman. And he put all the
      facts before the boy, made clear to him the all-determining importance of
      the issue:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Choose well, your choice is
    Brief and yet endless!"
</pre>
    <p>
      On the one hand was slavery and degradation and disease; and on the other
      were all the heights of the human spirit. For if one saved and stored this
      mighty sex-energy, it became transmuted to the gold of intellectual and
      emotional power. Such was the universal testimony of the masters of the
      higher life&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "My strength is as the strength of ten
    Because my heart is pure."
</pre>
    <p>
      And this was no blind asceticism; it was simply a choosing of the best. It
      was not a denial of love, but on the contrary a consecration of love. Some
      day Thyrsis would meet the woman he was to cleave to, and he would expect
      her to come to him a virgin; and he must honor her as much&mdash;he must
      save the fire and fervor of his young desire for his life's great
      consummation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the ideal; and these two men made a compact between them, that
      once every month Thyrsis would write and tell of his success or failure.
      And this amateur confessional was a mighty motive to the lad&mdash;he knew
      that he could never tell a lie, and the thought of telling the truth was
      like a sword hanging over him. There were hours of trial, when he stood so
      close to the edge of the precipice that this alone was what kept him
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. The summer had come, and Thyrsis had gone away to live in a
      country village, and was reading Keats and Shelley, and the narrative
      poems of Scott. There came a soft warm evening, when all the world seemed
      a-dream; and he had been working hard, and there came to him a yearning
      for the stars. He went out, and was strolling through the streets of the
      village, when he saw a girl come out of one of the houses. She was younger
      than he, graceful of form, and pretty. The lamp-light flashed on her
      bright cheeks, and she smiled at him as she passed. And Thyrsis' heart
      gave a great leap, and the blood surged to his face; he turned and looked,
      and saw that she was gazing over her shoulder at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and turned to follow, his meditations all gone, and gone his
      resolutions. A trembling seized him, and every nerve of him tingled. He
      could feel his heart as if it were underneath his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more he was beside the girl. "May I join you?" he asked, and
      she replied with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis moved beside her and took her arm in his. A moment later they came
      to a place where the road was dark, and he put his arm about her waist;
      she made no resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I've seen you often before," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he replied, "I have seen you." And he suddenly remembered a remark
      that he had heard about her. There was a large summer-hotel in this
      neighborhood, which as usual had brought all the corruptions of the city
      in its train; and a youth whom Thyrsis had met there had pointed out the
      girl with the remark, "She's a little beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this idea, as it came to him, swept him away in a fierce tide of
      madness; he bent suddenly down and whispered into her ear. They were words
      that never in Thyrsis' life had passed his lips before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl pushed him away; but she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mind, do you?" exclaimed Thyrsis, his heart thumping like a
      hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen," he whispered, bending towards her. "Let us go and take a walk.
      Let us go where no one will see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out into the country," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now," she replied. "Some other time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, now!" exclaimed Thyrsis, desperately. "Now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been moving slowly; they came to a place where a great tree hung
      over the road, shadowing it; and there they stopped, as by one impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me," he whispered, swiftly. "Listen. You don't know how anxious
      I have been to meet you. It's true&mdash;indeed it's true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. "Yes," said the girl, "and I have been wanting to meet you.
      Didn't you ever see me nod to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Thyrsis put his arms about her, and pressed her to him. The
      touch of her bosom sent the blood driving through his veins in torrents of
      fire; he no longer knew or cared what he said, or what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me," he raced on. "Listen to me! Nobody will know! And you are
      so beautiful, so beautiful! I love you!" The words burned his lips, but he
      forced himself to say them, again and again&mdash;"I love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was gazing around her nervously. "Not now," she exclaimed. "Not
      to-night. To-morrow I will meet you, to-morrow night, and go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," cried Thyrsis, "not to-morrow night, but now!" And he clasped her
      yet more tightly, with all his strength. "Listen," he panted, his breath
      on her cheek. "I love you! I cannot wait till to-morrow&mdash;I could not
      bear it. I am all on fire! I should not know what to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gazed about her again in uncertainty, and Thyrsis swept on in his
      swift, half-incoherent exclamations. He would take no refusal; for half
      his madness was terror of himself, and he knew it. And then suddenly, as
      he cried out to her, the girl whispered, faintly, "All right!" And his
      heart gave a throb that hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you," she went on, hastily, "I was going to the store for
      something, and they expect me home. But wait here till I get back, and
      then I'll go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it?" whispered Thyrsis. "You mean it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it will be soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said he. "But first give me a kiss." As she held up her face,
      Thyrsis pressed her to him, and kissed her again and again, until her
      cheeks were aflame. At last he released her, and she turned swiftly and
      darted up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. And after she was gone the boy stood there motionless, not
      stirring even a hand. A full minute passed, and the color went out of his
      cheeks, and the fire out of his veins, and he could hardly stand erect.
      His head sunk lower and lower, until suddenly he whispered hoarsely, under
      his breath, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at the sky, his face ghastly white; and there came from his
      throat a low moan, like that of a wounded animal. Suddenly he turned, and
      fled away down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on and on, block after block; but then, all at once, he stopped
      again and faced about. He gripped his hands until the nails cut him, and
      shut his teeth together like a steel-trap. "No, no!" he muttered. "No&mdash;you
      coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and began to march, grimly, as a soldier might; he went back,
      and stopped on the spot from which he had come; and there he stood, like a
      statue. So one minute passed, then another; and at last a shadow moved in
      the distance, and a step came near. It was the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am," she whispered, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis. "I have something I must say to you, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed the change in a flash, and she stopped. "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know just how to tell you," said Thyrsis, in a low, quivering
      voice. "I've been a hound, and now I don't want to be a cad. But I'm sorry
      for what we were talking about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean what <i>you</i> were talking about, don't you?" demanded the
      girl, her eyes flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis dropped his glance. "Yes," he said. "I am a cur. I beg your
      pardon. I am so ashamed of myself that I don't know what to do. But, oh, I
      was crazy. I couldn't help it! and I&mdash;I'm so sorry!" There were tears
      in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph," said the girl, "it's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Thyrsis, "it's all wrong. It's dreadful&mdash;it's horrible. I
      don't know what I should have done&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you better not do it any more, that's all," said she. "I'm sure you
      needn't worry about me&mdash;I'll take care of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis looked at her again; she was no longer beautiful. Her face was
      coarse, and her anger did not make it any better. His humility made no
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so wrong&mdash;-" he began; but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preaching won't help it any," she said. "I don't want to hear it.
      Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she turned and walked away; and Thyrsis stood there, white, and
      shuddering, until at last he started and strode off. Clear through the
      town he went, and out into the black country beyond, seeing nothing,
      caring about nothing. He flung himself down by the roadside, and lay there
      moaning for hours: "My God, my God, what shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. It was nearly morning when he came back and crept upstairs to
      his room; and here he sat by the bedside, gazing at the haggard face in
      the glass. At such times as this he discovered a something in his features
      that filled him with shuddering; he discovered it in his words, and in the
      very tone of his voice&mdash;the sins of the fathers were being visited
      upon the children! What an old, old story it was to him&mdash;this anguish
      and remorse! These ecstasies of resolution that vanished like a
      cloud-wrack&mdash;these protestations and noble sentiments that counted
      for naught in conduct! And his was to be the whole heritage of impotence
      and futility; he, too, was to struggle and agonize&mdash;and to finish
      with his foot in the trap!
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was like a white-hot goad to him. After such an experience there
      would be several months of toil and penance, and of savage
      self-immolation. It was hard to punish a man who had so little; but
      Thyrsis managed to find ways. For several months at a time he would go
      without those kinds of food that he liked; and instead of going to bed at
      one o'clock he would read the New Testament in Greek for an hour. He would
      leap out of bed in the morning and plunge into cold water; and at night,
      when he felt a longing upon him, he would go out and run for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took to keeping diaries and writing exhortations to himself. Because he
      could no longer use the theological prayers he had been taught, he
      fashioned new invocations for himself: prayers to the unknown sources of
      his vision, to the new powers of his own soul&mdash;"the undiscovered
      gods," as he called them. Above all he prayed to his vision of the maiden
      who waited the issue of this battle, and held the crown of victory in her
      keeping&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Somewhere beneath the sun,
      Those quivering heart-strings prove it,
    Somewhere there must be one
      Made for this soul to love it&mdash;

    Some one whom I could court
      With no great change of manner,
    Still holding reason's fort,
      While waving fancy's banner!"
</pre>
    <p>
      All of which things made a subtle change in his attitude to Corydon, whom
      he still met occasionally. Corydon was now a young lady, beautiful, even
      stately, with an indescribable atmosphere of gentleness and purity about
      her. All things unclean shrunk from her presence; and so in times of
      distress he liked to be with her. He would drop vague hints as to
      sufferings and temptations, and told her that she seemed like a "goddess"
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon received this with some awe, but with more perplexity. She could
      not understand why anyone should struggle so much, or why a youth should
      take such a sombre view of things. But she was perfectly willing to seem
      like a "goddess" to anyone, and she was glad if that helped him. She was
      touched when he read her a poem of his own, a poem which he held very
      precious. He called it
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "A song of the young-eyed Cherubim
    In the days of the making of man."
</pre>
    <p>
      And in it he had set forth the view of life that had come to him&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "The quest of the spirit's gain&mdash;
      Lured by the graces of pleasure,
    And lashed by the furies of pain.
      Thy weakness shall sigh for an Eden,
    But the sword shall flame at the gate;
      For far is the home of thy vision
    And strong is the hand of thy fate!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 13. Though Thyrsis had no time to realize it, it was in this long
      and bitter struggle that he won whatever power he had in his future life.
      It was here that he learned "to hold his will above him as his law", and
      to defy the world for the sake of his ideal. And then, too, this toil was
      the key that opened to him the treasure-house of a new art&mdash;which was
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until he was nearly out of college Thyrsis had scarcely heard any music at
      all. Church-hymns he had learned, and a few songs in school. But now in
      poetry and other books he met with references to composers, and to the
      meaning of great music; and the things that were described there were the
      things he loved, and he began to feel a great eagerness to get at them. As
      a first step he bought a mandolin, and set to work to teach himself to
      play, a task at which he wrought with great diligence. At the same time a
      friend had bought a guitar, and the two set to work to play duets. The
      first preliminary was the getting of the instruments in tune; and not
      knowing that the mandolin is an octave higher than the guitar, they spent
      a great deal of time and broke a great many guitar-strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the next step, Thyrsis went to hear a great pianist, and sat perplexed
      and wondering. There was a girl next to him who sobbed, and Thyrsis
      watched her as he might have watched a house on fire. Only once the
      pianist pleased <i>him</i>&mdash;when he played a pretty little piece
      called somebody's "impromptu", in which he got a gleam of a "tune." Poor
      Thyrsis went and got that piece, and took it home to study it, with the
      help of the mandolin; but, alas, in the maze of notes he could not even
      find the "tune."
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he could not understand the music, he could read books about it; he
      read a whole library&mdash;criticism of music, analysis of music,
      histories of music, composers of music; and so gradually he learned the
      difference between a sarabande and a symphony, and began to get some idea
      of what he went out for to hear. At first, at the concerts, all he could
      think of was to crane his neck and recognize the different instruments; he
      heard whole symphonies, while doing nothing but watching for the
      "movements," and making sure he hadn't skipped any. One heartless composer
      ran two movements into one, and so Thyrsis' concert came out one piece
      short at the end, and he sat gazing about him in consternation when the
      audience rose to go. Afterwards he read long dissertations about each
      symphony before he went, and he would note down the important points and
      watch for them. The critic would expatiate upon "the long-drawn dissonance
      <i>forte</i>, that marks the close of the working-out portion"; and
      Thyrsis would watch for that long-drawn dissonance, and be wondering if it
      was never coming&mdash;when suddenly the whole symphony would come to an
      end! Or he would read about a "quaint capering measure led off by the
      bassoons," or a "frantic sweep of the violins over a trombone melody," and
      he would watch for these events with eyes and ears alert, and if he found
      them&mdash;<i>eureka</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      But such things could not last forever; for Thyrsis had a heart full of
      eagerness and love, and of such is the soul of music. And just then was a
      time when he was sick and worn&mdash;when it seemed to him that the burden
      of his life was more than he could bear. He was haunted by the thought
      that he would lose his long battle, that he would go under and go down;
      and then it was that chance took him to a concert which closed with the
      great "C-Minor Symphony."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had read a life of Beethoven, and he knew that here was one of the
      hero-souls&mdash;a man who had grappled with the fiends, and passed
      through the valley of death. And now he read accounts of this titan
      symphony, and learned that it was a battle of the human spirit with
      despair. He read Beethoven's words about the opening theme&mdash;"So
      knocks fate upon the door!" And a fierce and overwhelming longing
      possessed him to get at the soul of that symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the concert, and heard nothing of the rest of the music, but
      sat like a man in a dream; and when the time came for the symphony, he was
      trembling with excitement. There was a long silence; and then suddenly
      came the first theme&mdash;those fearful hammer-strokes that cannot be
      thought without a shudder. They beat upon Thyrsis' very heart-strings, and
      he sat appalled; and straight out he went upon the tide of that mighty
      music-passion&mdash;without knowing it, without knowing how. He forgot
      that he was trying to understand a symphony; he forgot where he was, and
      what he was; he only knew that gigantic phantoms surged within him, that
      his soul was a hundred times itself. He never guessed that an orchestra
      was playing a second theme; he only knew that he saw a light gleam out of
      the storm, that he heard a voice, pitiful, fearful, beautiful beyond
      utterance, crying out to the furies for mercy; and that then the storm
      closed over it with a roar. Again and again it rose; Thyrsis did not know
      that this was the "working-out portion" that had forever been his bane. He
      only knew that it struggled and fought his fight, that it pleaded and
      sobbed, and rose higher and higher, and began to rejoice&mdash;and that
      then came the great black phantom-shape sweeping over it; and the iron
      hammer-strokes of Fate beat down upon it, crushed it and trampled it into
      annihilation. Again and again this happened, while Thyrsis sat clutching
      the seat, and shaking with wonder and excitement. Never in his experience
      had there been anything so vast, so awful; it was more than he could bear,
      and when the first movement came to an end&mdash;when the soul's last hope
      was dead&mdash;he got up and rushed out. People who passed him on the
      streets must have thought that he was crazy; and afterwards, that day and
      forever, he lived all his soul's life in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of this Thyrsis paid all his bank-account for a violin, and
      went to see a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too old," the teacher said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thyrsis answered, "I will work as no one ever worked before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all do that," replied the other, with a smile. And so they began.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so all day long, with fingers raw, and arms and back shuddering with
      exhaustion, Thyrsis sat and practiced, the spirit of Music beckoning him
      on. It was in a boarding-house, and there was a nervous old man in the
      next room, and in the end Thyrsis had to move. By the time he went away to
      the country, he was able to play a melody in tune; and then he would take
      some one that had fascinated him, and practice it and practice it night
      and day. He would take his fiddle every morning at eight and stride out
      into the forest, and there he would stay all day with the squirrels. They
      told him once how a new arrival, driving over in the hotel 'bus at early
      dawn, had passed an old Italian woman toiling up a hill and singing for
      dear life the "Tannhauser March." It chanced that the new arrival was a
      musician, and he leaned out and asked the old woman where she had learned
      it. And this was her explanation;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey ees a crazy feller in de woods&mdash;he play it all day for tree
      weeks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 14. By this time Thyrsis had finished at college, passing
      comfortably near the bottom of his class, and had betaken himself to a
      university as a graduate student. He was duly registered for a lot of
      courses, and spent his time when he should have been at the lectures,
      sitting in a vacant class-room reading the book that had fascinated him
      last. His note-book began at that time to show two volumes a day on an
      average, and once or twice he stopped at night to wonder how it had
      actually been possible for him to read poetry fourteen hours a day for a
      whole week and not be tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He taught himself German, and that led to another great discovery&mdash;he
      made the acquaintance of Goethe. The power of that mighty spirit took hold
      of him, so that he prayed to him when he was lonely, and kept the
      photograph of the young poet in his pocket, to gaze at it as at a lover.
      The great eyes came to haunt him so that one night he awoke crying out,
      because he had dreamed he was going to meet Goethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the catalog of the university there were listed a number of courses in
      "rhetoric and English composition". They were for the purpose of teaching
      one how to write, and the catalog set forth convincingly the methods
      whereby this was done. Thyrsis wished to know all there was to know about
      writing, and so ne enrolled himself for an advanced course, and went for
      an hour every day and listened to expositions of the elements of
      sentence-structure by Prof. Osborne, author of "American Prose Writers"
      and "The Science of Rhetoric". The professor would give him a theme, and
      bid him bring in a five-hundred word composition. Perhaps it was that
      Thyrsis was lacking in the play-spirit; at any rate he could not write
      convincingly on the subject of "The Duty of the College Man to Support
      Athletics." He struggled for a month against his own impotence, and then
      went to see his instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," he said, "I shall have to drop Course A."
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor gazed over his spectacles at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I am getting any good out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you tell what good you are getting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't seem to feel that I am," said Thyrsis, deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not to be supposed that you would feel it," said the other&mdash;"not
      at this early stage. You must wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't like the method, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong with the method?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was embarrassed. He was not sure, he said; but he did not think
      that writing could be taught. Anyway, one had first to have something
      worth saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you laboring under the delusion that you know anything about
      writing?" demanded the professor. (He had written across Thyrsis' last
      composition the words, "Feeble and trivial".)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," began the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because if you are, let me disabuse your mind at once. There is no one in
      the class who knows less about writing than yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Thyrsis, "it's because I can't bring myself to write in
      cold blood. I have to be interested. I'm sure that is the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure," said the other, "that the trouble is that you think you know
      too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, sir," said Thyrsis, humbly. "I've tried my best&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my business to teach students to write. I've given my life to that,
      and I think I know something about it. But you think you know more than I
      do. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they parted. Thyrsis kept a vivid recollection of this interview,
      for the reason that at a later stage of his career he came into contact
      with Prof. Osborne again, and got another glimpse of the authoritarian
      attitude towards the art of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 15. Thyrsis had not many friends at college, and none at all at the
      university. He had no time to make any; and besides, there was a certain
      facetious senior who had caught him hurrying through the corridors one
      day, declaring in excitement that&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
    On its roof did float and flow!"
</pre>
    <p>
      But he had long ago ceased to hope for a friend, or to care what anybody
      thought about him; it was clear to him by this time that he had made
      himself into a poet, and was doomed to be unhappy. His mother had given up
      all hope of seeing him a bishop, and they had compromised upon a
      judgeship; but here at the university there was a law-school, and he met
      the students, and saw that this, too, could not be. These "lawyers" were
      not seeking knowledge for the love of it&mdash;they were studying a trade,
      by which they could rise in the world. They were not going out to do
      battle for truth and justice&mdash;they were perfecting themselves in
      cunning, so that they might be of help in money-disputes; they were
      sharpening their wits, to make them useful tools for the opening of
      treasure-chests. And this attitude to life was written all over their
      personalities; they seemed to Thyrsis a coarse and roistering crew, and he
      shrunk from them in repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went his own impetuous way. He stayed at the university until he had
      taught himself French and Italian, as well as German, and had read all the
      best literature in those languages. And likewise he heard all the best
      music, and went about full of it day and night. By this time he had
      definitely beaten his devils, and had come to be master of himself; and
      though nobody guessed anything about it, there was a new marvel going on
      within him&mdash;he had, in a spiritual sense, become pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many signs by which this state might have been known. He went
      quite alone, and spoke to no man; he was self-absorbed, and walked about
      with his eyes fixed on vacancy; he was savage when disturbed, and guarded
      his time unscrupulously. He had given up the very last of the formalities
      of life&mdash;he no longer attended any lectures, or wore cuffs, and he
      would not talk at meal-times. He took long walks at impossible hours, and
      he was fond of a certain high hill where the storms blew. These things had
      been going on for a year; and now the book that had been coming to
      ripeness in his mind was ready to be born.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had its origin in the reading of history, and the fronting of old
      tyranny in its cruel forms. Thyrsis had come to hate Christianity for many
      things by that time, but most of all he hated it because it taught the
      bastard virtue of Obedience. Thyrsis obeyed no man&mdash;he lived his
      life; and the fiery ardor with which he lived it was taking form in his
      mind as a personality. He was dreaming a hero who should be <i>Resistance</i>
      incarnate; the passionate assertion of man's right and of man's defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the days of ferocity in Italy, the days of the despot and the
      bravo; and Thyrsis' hero was a minstrel, a mighty musician whose soul was
      free. And he sung in the despot's hall, and wooed the despot's daughter.
      This was the minstrel of "Zulieka"&mdash;-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "His ladder of song was slight,
    But it reached to her window's height;
    Each verse so frail was the silken rail,
    From which her soul took flight."
</pre>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went about quite drunk with the burning words with which the
      minstrel won the lady, and tore her free from the mockeries of convention,
      and that divinity that doth hedge about a princess. He bore her away,
      locked tightly in his arms, and all his own&mdash;into the great lonely
      mountains; and there lived the minstrel and the princess, the lord and the
      lady of an outlaw band. But the outlaws were cruel, and the minstrel
      sought goodness; and so there was a struggle, and he and the lady went yet
      deeper into the black forest, where they dwelt alone in a hut, he a prince
      of hunters and she a princess of love. But the outlaws led the despot to
      the place, and there was a battle; the princess was slain, and the
      minstrel escaped in the darkness. All night he roamed the forest, and in
      the morning he lay by the roadside with a bow in his hand, and when the
      despot rode by he rose and drove the shaft through his heart. Then they
      captured him, and tortured him, and he died with a song of mockery and
      defiance upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 16. Now, when these things first came to Thyrsis, he whispered in
      awe that it would be a life-time before he could write them. And a year
      passed thus, while every emotion of his life poured itself into some part
      of that story, and every note of music that he heard came out of the
      minstrel's heart. At last the time came when he was so full of it that he
      could no longer find peace; when the wonder of it was such that he walked
      along the street laughing, and with tears in his eyes. Then he said to
      himself, "It must be done! Now! Now!" And he looked about him as a woman
      might, seeking some place for her labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was in the late winter, when the professors at the university, and
      all his relatives and acquaintances, had given him up as a hopeless case.
      He had stopped all his writing for money&mdash;he had a hundred dollars
      laid by, and that would suffice him; and he was wandering about whispering
      to himself: "The spring-time! The spring-time! For it must be in the
      country!" When April had come he could stand it no longer&mdash;he must
      go! So he left all behind him, and set out for a place in the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached it, he found a lake that was all ice, and mountains that
      were all snow; the country people, who had never seen a poet, and knew not
      the subtle difference between inspiration and insanity, heard with wonder
      that he was going out into the woods. But he set out alone, through the
      snowy forest and along the lake-shore, to find some place far away, where
      he could build a hut, or even put up a tent; and when he was miles from
      the village, he came suddenly on a little wonderland that made his heart
      leap like the wild deer in the brake. Here was a dreamland palace, a
      vision beyond all thinking&mdash;a little shanty built of logs! It stood
      in a pretty dell, with a mountain streamlet dashing through it, and the
      mighty forest hiding it, and the lake spread out in front of it. It was
      all wet snow, and freezing rain, and mud and desolation; but Thyrsis saw
      the summer that was to be, and he sat down upon a stone and gazed at it,
      and laughed and sang for wonder and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he fled back to the village, and found the owner of the earthly
      rights to this paradise, and hired it for a little gold; and then he moved
      out, in spite of the snow. At last his soul was free!
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice a week they brought him provisions, and there he stayed. At first he
      nearly froze at night, and he had to write with his gloves on; but he did
      not feel the cold, because of the fire within. He climbed the mountains
      and yelled with the mad wind, and tramped through the bare, rocking
      forest, singing his minstrel songs. And all these days he walked with God,
      and there was no world at all save the world of nature. Millions of
      young-hearted things sprang up out of the ground to welcome him; the
      forests shook out their dazzling sheen, and the wild birds went mad in the
      mornings. All the time Thyrsis was writing, writing&mdash;thrilling with
      his ecstasy, and pouring out all his soul. He kept a little diary these
      days, and for weeks there was but one entry&mdash;"The book! The book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then one day came a letter from his mother, saying that she was coming
      to the village nearby to spend the summer; also that Corydon's mother was
      coming, and that Corydon would be with her!

      BOOK II. THE SNARE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The streamlet tinkled on. She sat, gazing about her at each familiar
      tree and rock. And meanwhile he was reading again from the book&mdash;
      </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assay'd!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Is that from 'Thyrsis'?" she asked. "Read me those lines that we used, to
      love so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he turned the page, and read again&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,
      Shy to illumine; and I seek it, too.
        This does not come with houses or with gold,
      With place, with honor, and a flattering crew:
       'Tis not in the world's market bought and sold&mdash;
            But the smooth-slipping weeks
    Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;
      Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,
      He wends unfollow'd, he must house alone;
    Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. On the train Corydon was writing a letter to a friend, to say
      where she was going, and that Thyrsis was there. "I don't expect to see
      anything of him," she wrote. "He grows more egotistical and more
      contemptuous every day, and I cordially dislike him."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when a man has spent three or four weeks with no company save the
      squirrels and the owls, there comes over him a mood of sociability, when
      the sight of a friendly face is an event. Thyrsis had now written several
      chapters of his book, and the first fury of his creative impulse had spent
      itself. So when Corydon stepped from the train, she found him waiting
      there to greet her; and he told her that he was laying in supplies for a
      feast, and that on the morrow she and her mother were to come out and see
      his fairy-palace and have a picnic dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came; and the May put on her finest raiment for their greeting. The
      sun shone warm and bright, and there was a humming and stirring in grass
      and thicket; one could feel the surge of the spring-time growth as a
      living flood. There was a glory of young green over the hill-sides, and a
      quivering sheen of white in the aspens and birches. Corydon clasped her
      hands and cried out in rapture when she saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis, picturesque in his old corduroy trousers and his grey flannel
      shirt, played the host. He showed them his domestic establishment&mdash;wherein
      things were set in order for the first time since he had come. He told all
      his adventures: how the cold had crept in at night, and he had to fiddle
      to keep his courage up; how he had slept in a canvas-cot for the first
      time, and piled all the bedding on top, and wondered that he was cold; how
      he had left the pail with the freshly-roasted beef on the piazza, and a
      wild cat had carried off pail and all. He made fun of his amateur
      house-keeping&mdash;he would forget things and let them burn, or let the
      fire go out; and he had tried living altogether on cold food, to the great
      perplexity of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave a demonstration of his hard-won culinary skill. He boiled
      rice and raisins, and fried bacon and eggs; and they had fresh bread and
      butter, and jam and pickles, and a festive cake. And after they had
      feasted, Thyrsis stretched himself and leaned back against the trunk of a
      tree, and gazed up at the sky, quoting the words of a certain one-eyed
      Kalandar, son of a king, "Verily, this indeed is life! 'Tis pity 'tis
      fleeting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he took Corydon for a walk. They climbed the hill where he came
      to battle with the stormwinds, and to watch the sunsets and the moon
      rising over the lake. And then they went down into the glen, where the
      mountain streamlet tumbled. Here had been wood-sorrel, and a carpet of the
      white trillium; and now there was adder's tongue, quaint and saucy, and
      columbine, and the pale dusty corydalis. There was soft new moss
      underfoot, and one walked as if in a temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis pointed out a seat beside a deep bubbling pool. "Here's where I
      sit and write," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how comes the book?" asked Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm hammering at it&mdash;that's the best I can say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;it's a story. I suppose it'll be called a romance, though I
      don't like the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon pondered for a moment. "I wouldn't expect you to be writing
      anything romantic," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis, occupied with his own thoughts, observed, "I might call it a
      revolutionary romance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. "It happens in the middle ages," he said. "There's a
      minstrel and a princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds interesting," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the period of pregnancy the artist's mood is one of secretiveness.
      But afterwards there comes a time for promulgation and rejoicing; and
      already there had been hints of this in the mind of Thyrsis. The great
      secret that he was cherishing&mdash;what would be the world's reception of
      it? And now suddenly a wild idea came to him. He had heard somewhere that
      it is the women who read fiction. And was not Corydon a perfect specimen
      of the average middle-class young lady, and therefore of that mysterious
      potentiality, "the public", to which he must appeal? Why not see what she
      would think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the plunge. "Would you like me to read it to you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly," she replied, and then added, gently, "If it wouldn't be
      a desecration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Thyrsis. "You see, when it's been printed, all sorts of
      people will read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went back to the house and brought the precious manuscript; and he
      placed Corydon in the seat of inspiration, and sat beside her and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many ways this was a revolutionary romance. Thyrsis had not spent any
      of his time delving into other people's books for "local color"; he was
      not relying for his effects upon gabardines and hauberks, and a sprinkling
      of "Yea, sires," and "prithees." His castle was but the vaguely outlined
      background of a stage upon which living hearts wrought out their passions.
      One saw the banquet-hall, with its tapestries and splendor, and the master
      of it, the man of force; there were swift scenes that gave one a glimpse
      of the age-long state of things&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Right forever on the scaffold,
    Wrong forever on the throne."
</pre>
    <p>
      There was a quarrel, and a cruel sentence about to be executed; and then
      the minstrel came. His fame had come before him, and so the despot, in
      half-drunken playfulness, left the deciding of the quarrel to him. He was
      brought to the head of the table, and the princess was led in; and so
      these two met face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Thyrsis paused, and asked, "Are you interested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, go on," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he read about his princess, who was the embodiment of all the virtues
      of the unknown goddess of his fancy. She was proud yet humble, aloof yet
      compassionate, and above all ineffably beautiful. And as for the minstrel&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "The minstrel was fair and young.
    His heart was of love and fire."
</pre>
    <p>
      He took his harp, and first he pacified the quarrel, and then he sang to
      the lady. He sang of love, and the poet's vision of beauty; but most of
      all he sang of the free life of the open. He sang of the dreams and the
      spirit-companions of the minstrel, and of the wondrous magic that he
      wields&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Secrets of all future ages
      Hover in mine ecstasy;
    Treasures never known to mortals
      Hath my fancy hid for thee!"
</pre>
    <p>
      He sang the spells that he would weave for her, the far journeys she
      should take&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "For thy soul a river flowing
      Swiftly, over golden sands,
    With the singing of the steersman
      Stealing into wonderlands!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 2. This song was as far as Thyrsis had written, and he paused.
      Corydon was sitting with her hands clasped, and a look of enthrallment
      upon her face. "Oh, beautiful! beautiful!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of pleasure went through the poet. "You like it, then?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I like it!" she answered. And then she gazed at him, with wide-open
      eyes of amazement. "But you! You!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not I?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How in the world did you do it? Where did you get it from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is mine," said Thyrsis, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't imagine it! I had no idea you were interested in such
      things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how could you know what I am interested in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see how you live&mdash;apart from everybody. And you spend all your
      time in books!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis suddenly recollected something which had amused him very much.
      Corydon had been reading "Middlemarch," and had told him that Dr. Casaubon
      reminded her of him. "And so I'm still just a bookworm to you!" he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't your interest in things always intellectual?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you suppose I'm doing this just as an exercise in technique?" he
      countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's taken me quite by surprise," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have three faculties in us," Thyrsis propounded&mdash;"intellect,
      feeling, and will; and to be a complete human being, we have to develop
      all of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you spend so much time piling up learning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need to know a great many things," he said. "I'm not conscious of
      studying anything I don't need for my purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the purpose?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the precious manuscript. "This," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you lose so much when you cut yourself off from the world," said
      Corydon. "And there are other people, whom you might help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People don't need my help; or at least, they don't want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you know that&mdash;if you never go among them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can judge by the lives they live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Corydon, quickly, "but people aren't to blame for the
      lives they live!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;they can't help them. They are bound fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They should break loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is easy for you to say," said Corydon. "You have no ties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did have them&mdash;I might have them still. But I broke them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you are a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference does that make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It makes all the difference in the world. You can earn money, you can go
      away by yourself. But suppose you were a girl&mdash;shut up in a home, and
      told that that was your 'sphere'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd fight," said Thyrsis&mdash;"I'd break my way out somehow, never fear.
      If one doesn't break out, it simply means that his desire is not strong
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had been surprised at the depth of Corydon's interest in his
      manuscript; he had not supposed that she would be so susceptible to
      anything of the imagination. And now he was surprised to see that her
      hands were clenched tightly, and that she sat staring ahead of her
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you dissatisfied with your life?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything in it that I could be satisfied with?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no idea of that," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she replied; "that only shows how stupid you can be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;you never showed any signs&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you know that I was trying to prepare for college last year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but you gave it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I do? I had no help&mdash;no encouragement. I was groping like
      a blind person. And I told you about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I told you what to study," objected Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the girl; "but how could I do it? You know how to study&mdash;you've
      been taught. But I don't know anything, and I don't know how to find
      anything out. I began on the Latin, but I didn't even know how the words
      should be pronounced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody else knows that," observed Thyrsis, somewhat inconsequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was all so dull and dreary," she went on&mdash;"everything they would
      have had me learn. I wanted things that had life in them, things that were
      beautiful and worth while&mdash;like this book of yours, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am really delighted that you like it," said Thyrsis, touched by that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me the rest of it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Thyrsis told his story at some length; in the ardor of her
      sympathy his imagination took fire, and he told it eloquently, he
      discovered new beauties in it that he had not seen before. And Corydon
      listened with growing delight and amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that is the way you spend your time!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the way," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is why you live like a hermit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think that you would lose your vision if you went among people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know because I have tried. You don't realize how hard I have to work
      over a thing like this. I have carried it in my mind for a year; I have
      lived for nothing else&mdash;I have literally had no other interest in the
      world. Every sentence I have read to you has been the product of work
      added to work&mdash;of one impulse piled upon another&mdash;of thinking
      and criticizing and revising. Just the little bit I have done has taken me
      a whole month, and I have hardly stopped to eat; it's been my first
      thought in the morning and my last at night. And when the mood of it comes
      to me, then I work in a kind of frenzy that lasts for hours and even days;
      and if I give up in the middle and fall back, then I have to do it all
      over again. It's like toiling up a mountain-side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," whispered Corydon. "And then, do you expect to have no human
      relationships as long as you live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis pondered for a moment. "Did you ever read Mrs. Browning's poem, 'A
      Musical Instrument'?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a most beautiful poem," he said; "and it's hardly ever quoted or
      read, that I can find. It tells how the great god Pan came down by the
      river-bank, and cut one of the reeds to make himself a pipe. He sat there
      and played his music upon it&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!
      Piercing sweet by the river!
    Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!
    The sun on the hill forgot to die,
    And the lilies reviv'd, and the dragon-fly
      Came back to dream on the river.

   'Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
      To laugh as he sits by the river,
    Making a poet out of a man.
    The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,&mdash;
    For the reed which grows nevermore again
      As a reed with the reeds in the river.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Thyrsis paused. "Do you see what it means?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Corydon, "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Making a poet out of a man!' That is one of the finest lines I know. And
      that's the way I feel about it&mdash;I have given up all other duties in
      the world. If I can write one book, or even one poem, that will be an
      inspiration to men in the future&mdash;why, then I have done far more than
      I could do by a lifetime given to helping people around me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never understood before," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the idea the minstrel tries to voice to the princess. At first he
      pours out his soul to her; but then, when he finds that she loves him, he
      is afraid, and tries to persuade her not to come with him. He tells her
      how lonely and stern his life is; and she has been born to a gentle life&mdash;she
      has her station and her duty in the world. But the more he pleads the
      hardness of his life, the more she sees she must go with him. Even if the
      end be death to her, still she will be an inspiration to him, and give
      wings to his music. 'Be silent,' she tells him&mdash;'let me fling myself
      away for a song! To do one deed that the world remembers, to utter one
      word that lives forever&mdash;that is worth all the failure and the agony
      that can come to one woman in her lifetime!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon sat with her hands clasped. "Yes," she said, "that is the way she
      would feel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to hear you say that," remarked the other. "I must make it real;
      and I've been afraid about it. Would she really go with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would go if she loved him," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she loved him. But she must love his art still more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must love <i>him,"</i> said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis shook his head. "It would not do for her to go with him for that,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Doesn't he love her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but he is afraid to tell her so. They dare not let that sway them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand. Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because personal love is a limited thing, and comparatively an ignoble
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how there can be anything more noble than true love between a
      man and a woman," declared Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on what you mean by 'true' love," replied Thyrsis. "If two
      people love each other for their own sakes, and go together, they soon
      come to know each other, and then they are satisfied&mdash;and their
      growth is at an end. What I conceive is that two people must lose
      themselves, and all thought of themselves, in their common love for
      something higher&mdash;for some great ideal, some purpose, some vision of
      perfection. And they seek this together, and they rejoice in finding it,
      each for the other; and so they have always progress and growth&mdash;they
      stand for something new to each other every day of their lives. To such
      love there is no end, and no chance of weariness or satiety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had never thought of it just so," said the girl. "But surely there must
      be a personal love in the beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," he responded. "I hadn't thought about that. I'm afraid I'm
      impersonal by nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said, "that's what has puzzled me. Don't you love human
      beings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as a rule," he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then&mdash;what is it you are interested in? Yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "People tell me that's the case. And there's a sense in which it's true&mdash;I'm
      wrapped up in the thought of myself as an art-work. I've a certain vision
      of the possibilities of my own being, and I'm trying to realize it. And if
      I do, then I can write books and communicate it to other people, so that
      they can judge it, and see if it's any better than the vision they have.
      It is a higher kind of unselfishness, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Corydon. "It's not easy to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one understands it," he replied. "People are taught that they must
      sacrifice themselves for others; and they do it, blindly and stupidly, and
      never ask if the other person is worthy of the sacrifice&mdash;and still
      less if they themselves have anything worth sacrificing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon had clenched her hands suddenly. "How I hate the religion of
      self-sacrifice!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is a religion of self-development," said Thyrsis. "I am sacrificing
      myself for what other people ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. They came back after a time, to the subject of love; and to the
      ideal of it which Thyrsis meant to set forth in the book. It was the duty
      of every soul to seek the highest potentiality of which it had vision; and
      as one did that for himself, so he did it for the person he loved. There
      could be no higher love than this&mdash;to treat the thing beloved as
      one's self, to be perpetually dissatisfied with it, to scourge it to new
      endeavor, to hold it in immortal discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a point about which they argued with eager excitement. To
      Thyrsis, love itself was a prize to be held before the loved one; whereas
      Corydon argued that love must exist before such a union could be thought
      of. Her cheeks flushed and her eyes shone as she maintained the thesis
      that the princess could not go with the minstrel unless his love was given
      to her irrevocably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean by love a sense of oneness in the pursuit of an ideal, then I
      agree with you," said Thyrsis. "But if you mean what love generally means&mdash;a
      mutual admiration, the worshipping of another personality&mdash;then I
      don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are lovers not even to be interesting to each other?" cried Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poet did not shrink even from that. "I don't think a woman could
      be interesting to me&mdash;except in so far as she was growing. And she
      must always know that if she stopped growing, she would cease to be
      interesting. That is not a matter of anybody's will, it seems to me&mdash;it
      is a fact of soul-chemistry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you will find many women to love you on that basis," said
      Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never expected to find but one," was Thyrsis' reply; "and I may not
      find even one."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat watching him for a moment. "I had never realized the sublimity of
      your egotism," she said. "It would never occur to you to judge anyone else
      by your own standards, would it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very well put," laughed Thyrsis. "As a matter of fact, I have a
      maxim that I count all things lost in the world but my own soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I can depend on my own soul; and I have not yet met anything else
      in life of which I can say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause. "You are as hard as iron!" exclaimed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am harder than anything you can find for your simile," he answered. "I
      know simply that there is no force existing that can turn me from my
      task."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might meet some woman who would fascinate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," he replied. "I have done things I'm ashamed of, and I've a
      wholesome fear of doing more of them. But I know that that woman, whoever
      she might be, would wake up some morning and find me missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a while he sat staring at the eddies in the pool below. "I have a
      vision of another kind of woman," he said&mdash;"a woman to whom my ideal
      would be the same compelling force that it is to me&mdash;a living thing
      that would drive her, that she was both master of, and slave to, as I am.
      So that she would feel no fears, and ask no favors! So that she would not
      want mercy, nor ask pledges&mdash;but just give herself, as I give myself,
      and take the chances of the game. Don't you think there may be just one
      such woman in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," was the reply. "But then&mdash;mightn't a woman be sure of your
      ideal, but not of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that," said Thyrsis, "she would have to know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that," said Corydon, "she would have to love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis smiled. "As in most arguments," he said, "it's mainly a matter
      of definitions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. At this point there came a call from the distance, and Corydon
      started. "There is mother," she exclaimed. "How the afternoon has flown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And must you go home now?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so," she replied. "We have a long row."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," he said. "I wanted to advise you about books to read. You
      must let me help you to find what you are seeking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Corydon, "if you only will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything I can," he said. "I am ashamed of not having helped
      you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had risen and started towards the house. "Can't you come to-morrow,
      and we can talk it over," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you were going to work," she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can spare another day," he replied. "A rest won't hurt me, I know. And
      it's been a real pleasure to talk to you this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they settled it; and Thyrsis saw them off in the boat, and then he went
      back to the little cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the steps he stood still. "Corydon!" he muttered. "Little Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was always the way he thought of her; not only because he had known
      her when she was a child, but because this expressed his conception of her&mdash;she
      was so gentle and peaceable and meek. She was now eighteen, and he was
      only twenty, but he felt towards her as a grandfather might. But now had
      come this new revelation, that astonished him. She had been deeply stirred
      by his work&mdash;she had loved it; and this was no affectation, it was
      out of her inmost heart. And she was not really contented at all&mdash;she
      had quite a hunger for life in her!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been like an explosion; the barriers had been destroyed between
      them, and he saw her as she really was. And he could hardly believe it&mdash;all
      through the adventures that followed he would find himself standing in the
      same kind of daze, whispering to himself&mdash;"Corydon! Little Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not try to do any work that evening. He thought about her, and the
      problem of her life. She had stirred him strangely; he saw her beautiful
      with a new kind of beauty. He resolved that he would put her upon the way
      to some of the joy she sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came early the next morning, and they sat by the lake-shore and
      talked. They talked about the things she needed to study, and how she
      should study them; about the books she had read and the books she was to
      read next. And from this they went on to a hundred questions of literature
      and philosophy and life. They became eager and excited; their thoughts
      took wings, and they lost all sense of time and place. There were so many
      things to be discussed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon, in spite of all her anti-clericalism, believed in immortality;
      she laid claim to intuitions and illuminations concerning it. And to
      Thyrsis, on the other hand, the idea of immortality was the consummation
      of all unfaith. To him life was a bubble upon the stream of time, a shadow
      of clouds upon the mountains; there was nothing about it that could be or
      should be immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The act of faith," he cried, "is to give ourselves into the arms of life,
      to take it as it comes, to rejoice in its infinite unfoldment, the
      'plastic dance of circumstance'; to behold the budding flower and the
      new-born suns as equal expressions of the joy of becoming. But people are
      weak, they love themselves, and they set themselves up as the centre of
      existence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corydon was personal, and loved life; and she stood out that death was
      unthinkable&mdash;that she had the sense of infinity within her. Thyrsis
      strove to make her see that one was to wreak one's hunger for infinity at
      each moment, and not put it off to any future age; that life was a thing
      for itself, and needed no sequel to justify it. "It is a free gift, and we
      have no claim upon it; we must take it on the terms of the giver."
    </p>
    <p>
      From that they came to religion. Thyrsis loved the forms of the old
      faiths, because of the poetry there was in them; and so he wrestled with
      Corydon's paganism. He tried to show her how one could read "Paradise
      Lost" and the English prayer-book, precisely as one read Virgil and Homer;
      to which Corydon answered that she had been to Sunday-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you once believed in Santa Claus!" he retorted. "And does that make
      you quarrel with him now? Every time you read a novel, don't you pretend
      to believe in people who never existed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to show her how much she lost of the sublime and inspiring
      things of the past. He took the story of Jesus. It mattered not in the
      least if it was fiction or fact&mdash;it was there, as an achievement of
      the human spirit. He showed her the man of the gospels&mdash;not the
      stained-glass god with royal robes and shining crown, but the humble
      workingman, with his dream of a heaven nearby, and a father who loved his
      children without distinction. He went about among the poor and humble, the
      world's first revolutionist; teaching the supremacy of the soul&mdash;a
      doctrine which was to be as dynamite beneath the pillars of all
      established institutions. He lived as a tramp and an outcast, and he died
      the death of a criminal; and now those who had murdered him were using his
      doctrines to enslave the world!&mdash;All this was a new idea to Corydon,
      and she resolved forthwith that she would begin her readings with the New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. So it went, until Thyrsis looked up with a start, and saw that
      the shadows were falling. It was five o'clock, and they had not stopped to
      eat! Even so, they had no time to cook, but made a cold meal&mdash;and
      talked all the time they were eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Corydon said, "I must start for home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't want any supper," said Thyrsis. "Let's see the sunset first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mother will be expecting me," she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll know you're all right," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they climbed the hill, and sat and watched the sunset and the rising
      full moon. The air was clear, and the sky like opal, and the pale, pearly
      tints of the clouds were ravishing to behold. To Thyrsis it seemed that
      these colors were an image of the soul that was disclosed to him. He would
      have been at a loss for words to describe the extraordinary sense of
      purity that Corydon gave to him; it was not simply her maidenhood&mdash;it
      was something far more rare than that. Here was an utterly perfect human
      soul; a soul without speck or blemish&mdash;without a base idea, with no
      trace of a vanity, unaware what a pretense might be. The joy and wonder of
      life welled spontaneously in her, she moved to a noble impulse as a cloud
      moves before the wind. She was like a creature from the skies they were
      watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, in the silver moonlight, a memorable hour came to them. Thyrsis
      told her of his consecration, and why he lived his hermit-life. He had
      known for years that he was not as other men; and now every hour it was
      becoming clearer to him. He shrunk from the word, because it had been
      desecrated by the world; but it was Genius. More and more frequently there
      was coming to him this strange ecstasy, the source of which he could not
      guess; it was like the giving way of flood-gates within him&mdash;the
      pouring in of a tide of wonder and joy. It made him tremble like a leaf,
      it made him cry aloud and fall down upon the ground exhausted. And yet,
      whatever the strain might be, he never lost his grip upon himself; rather,
      all the powers of his mind seemed to be multiplied&mdash;it seemed as if
      all existence became one with his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had he uttered a word of this to anyone. No one could
      understand the burden it had laid upon him. For this was the thing that
      all the world was seeking, for the lack of which the world was dying; and
      it was his to give or to withhold, to lose or to save. He had to forge it
      and shape it, he had to embody it, to set it forth in images and symbols.
      And that meant a terrific labor, a feat of mental and emotional endurance
      quite indescribable. He must hold it, though it burned like fire; he must
      clutch it to his bosom, though it tore at his heart-strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes," he said, "I fail and have to give up; and then I have nothing
      but a memory without words&mdash;or perhaps a few broken phrases that seem
      mere nonsense. Then I am like a man who has seen some loved one drowned or
      burned to death before his eyes. It is a thing so ineffable, so precious;
      and some power seeks to tear it away from me, to bear it into oblivion
      forever. I can't know, of course&mdash;it might come to some one else&mdash;or
      it might never come again. The feeling I have is like that of a mother for
      an unborn child; if I do not give it life, no one ever will. And don't you
      see&mdash;compared with that, what does anything else count? I would lie
      down and be crushed to pieces, if that would help; truly, I would suffer
      less than I suffer in what I try to do. And so, the things that other men
      care for&mdash;they simply don't exist for me. I must have a little money,
      because I have to have something to eat, and a place to work in. But I
      don't want position or fame&mdash;I don't shrink from any ridicule or
      humiliation. It seems like a mad thing to say, but I have nothing to do
      either with men's evil or with their good. I am not bound by any of their
      duties; I can't have any country or any home, I can't have wife or
      children&mdash;I can hardly even have any friends. Don't you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," whispered Corydon, deeply moved, "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," he went on&mdash;"see all the vice and misery in the world&mdash;the
      cruelty and greed and hate. And see all the stupid and petty things, the
      narrow motives, the vanities and the jealousies! And all that is because
      people haven't this thing that has come to me; they don't know the
      possibilities of life, they lack the sense of its preciousness and
      sacredness. And they seek and seek&mdash;and go astray! Take drunkenness,
      for instance; that brings them joy, but it's a false scent, it leads them
      over a precipice. I've been down at the bottom of it&mdash;you know why I
      have to go there, and what I've seen. And that is where the best of men's
      faculties go&mdash;yes, it's literally true! The men who are dull and
      plodding, they are contented; it's the men who are adventurous and
      aspiring who come to that precipice. I walk down an avenue and see the
      lines of saloons with their gleaming lights, and that thought is like a
      scream of anguish in my soul; there came a phrase to me once, that I
      wanted to cry out to people&mdash;'the graveyards of your genius! the
      graveyards of your genius!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon was gazing at his uplifted face. She said, "That is how Jesus must
      have felt, when he wept over Jerusalem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis. "It is a new religion trying to be born. Only
      nowadays they don't persecute you, they just ignore you. They don't hang
      you up on a cross and make you conspicuous and picturesque&mdash;they
      ridicule you and let you starve. And that is what I face, you see. I've
      saved a hundred dollars&mdash;just barely enough to buy me food until I've
      written the book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And other people have so much!" cried Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much&mdash;and no idea what to do with it. They just fling it away, in
      a drunken frenzy. And down below are the poor, who slave to make
      civilization possible. Such lives as they have to live&mdash;I can't ever
      get the thought out of my mind, not in any happiest moment! I feel as if I
      were a man who had escaped from a beleaguered city, and it all depended
      upon me to carry the tidings and bring relief. I'm their one hope, and if
      I fail them I'm a traitor, an accursed being! They are ignorant and
      helpless, and their cry comes to me like some great storm-wind of grief
      and despair. Oh, some day I mean to utter words that will reach them&mdash;I
      can't fail! I can't fail!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" whispered Corydon. "You must not fail!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I wish that I could help you!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can tell?" he answered. "Perhaps you may. A true friend is a rare
      thing to find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would do anything in the world to share in such a work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really mean that? As hard as it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would bear anything," she said. "I would go to the ends of the earth
      for it. I would fling away the whole world&mdash;just as you have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but are you strong enough? Could you stand it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that&mdash;I'm only a child. But I wouldn't mind dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came. It came as the dawn comes, unheralded, unheeded&mdash;spreading
      wider, till the day is there. Months afterwards they talked about it, and
      Thyrsis asked, "When did I propose to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you ever proposed to me," she answered. "It just came. It
      had to come&mdash;there was no other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when did I first kiss you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know even that," she said, and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I kiss you that night when we sat on the hill?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't have known it if you had," said Corydon. "It was as natural
      for you to kiss me as it was for me to draw my breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. The moon was high when they went down the hill, and he rowed her
      home. They were silent with the awe that was upon them. They found the
      people at home in a panic, but they scarcely knew this&mdash;and they
      scarcely troubled to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyrsis went home, and spent half the night roaming about in
      excitement. And early in the morning he was sitting on the edge of his
      canvas-cot, whispering to himself again, "Corydon! Little Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not think of work that day, but set out to walk to the village by
      the lonely mountain-road; and half-way there he met the girl, coming in
      the other direction. There was a light of wonder in her eyes; and also
      there was perplexity. For all that morning she had been whispering to
      herself, "Thyrsis! Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat by the roadside to talk it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon," he began, "I've been thinking about what we said last night,
      and it frightens me horribly. And I want to ask you please not to think
      about it any more. I could not take anyone else into my life&mdash;before
      God, I couldn't be so cruel. I have been shuddering at the thought of it.
      Oh please, please, run away from me&mdash;before it is too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the way it seems?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon!" he cried. "I am a tormented man! There can't be any happiness
      in the world for me. And you are so beautiful and so pure and so good&mdash;I
      simply dare not think of it! You must be happy, Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never yet been happy," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen," he went on&mdash;"there is a stanza of Walter Scott's that came
      to me this morning&mdash;an outlaw song. It seemed to sum up all my
      feeling about it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Maiden! a nameless life I lead,
      A nameless death I'll die;
    The fiend whose lantern lights the mead
      Were better mate than I!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Corydon sat staring ahead. "You can't frighten me away from you," she
      said, in a low voice. "It isn't worth your while to try. But let me tell
      you what I came to say. I'm so ignorant and so helpless&mdash;I didn't see
      how I could be of any use to you. And so I wanted to tell you that you
      must do whatever seemed best to you&mdash;just don't count me at all. You
      see what I mean&mdash;I'm not afraid for myself, but just for you. I
      couldn't bear the thought that I might be in your way. I felt I had to
      come and tell you that, before you went back to your work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Thyrsis had set out with mighty battlements reared about him; and not
      all the houris and the courtesans of all the ages could have found a way
      to breach them. But before those simple sentences of Corydon's, uttered in
      her gentle voice, and with her maiden's gaze of wonder&mdash;the
      battlements crumbled and rocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was always the way of it. There were endless new explanations and
      new attitudes, new excursions and discoveries. They would part with a
      certain understanding, but they never knew with what view they would meet
      in the morning. They were swung from one extreme to the other, from
      certitude to doubt, from joy to dismay and despair. And so, day after day
      they would sit and talk, for uncounted hours. Corydon would come to the
      little cabin, or Thyrsis would come to the village, and they would wander
      about the roads or the woods, forgetting their meals, forgetting all the
      world. Once they wandered away into the mountains, and they sat until the
      dusk closed round them; they were almost lost that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," Thyrsis had been saying, "we should not be married like other
      men and women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Corydon, "of course not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should be brother and sister," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it would not be real marriage&mdash;I mean, it would be just for the
      world's eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I don't see how it could hinder you," Corydon added. "Whatever I did
      that was wrong, you would tell me. And then too, about money. I shouldn't
      be any burden; for I have twenty-five dollars a month of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no idea of that," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've only had it for a year," said Corydon. "An aunt left me nearly four
      thousand dollars. I can't touch the principal until I'm thirty, but I have
      the income, and that will buy me everything I need. And so it would be
      just as if you didn't have me to think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think the money side matters so much," was his reply. "It's only
      this summer, you see&mdash;until I've finished the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. The key to all the future was the book; but alas, the book was
      not coming on. How could one write amid such excitement? This was a new
      kind of wine in Thyrsis' blood. This was reality! And before it his
      dream-phantoms seemed to have dissolved into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would make a compact for so many days, and he would start to work;
      but he would find himself thinking of Corydon, and new problems would
      arise, and he would take to writing her notes&mdash;and finally realize in
      despair that he might as well go and see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Corydon would be wrestling with tasks of her own. They had talked
      over her development, and agreed that what she needed was discipline. And
      because Thyrsis had read her some of Goethe's lyrics, she had decided to
      begin with German. Thyrsis had wasted a great deal of time with German
      courses in college, and so he was able to tell her everything not to do.
      He got her a little primer of grammar, just enough to make clear the
      language-structure; and then he set her to acquiring a vocabulary. He had
      little books full of words that he had prepared for himself, and these she
      drilled into her brain, all day and nearly all night. She stopped for
      nothing but to eat&mdash;in the woods when the weather was fair and in her
      room when it rained, she studied words, words, words! And she made amazing
      progress&mdash;while Thyrsis was wrestling with his angels she read
      Grimm's fairy tales, and some of Heyse's "Novellen," and "Hermann and
      Dorothea," and "Wilhelm Tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      But these were children's tasks, and her pilgrimage was one of despair.
      Above were the heights where Thyrsis dwelt, inaccessible, almost
      invisible; and how many years must she toil to reach them! She would come
      to him with tears in her eyes&mdash;tears of shame for her ignorance and
      her stupidity. And then Thyrsis would kiss the tears away, and tell her
      how many brilliant and clever women he had met, who had the souls of dolls
      behind all their display of culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Corydon would escape that unhappiness&mdash;but alas, only to fall into
      another kind. For she was a maiden, beautiful and tender, and ineffably
      precious to Thyrsis; and when they met, their hands would come together&mdash;it
      was as natural for them to embrace as for the flowers to grow. And this
      would lead to moods of weakness and satisfaction&mdash;not to that divine
      discontent, that rage of impatience which Thyrsis craved. It seemed to him
      that Corydon grew more and more in love with him, and more willing to
      cling to him; and he was savage because of his own complaisance. They
      would spend hours, exchanging endearments and whispering youthful
      absurdities; and then, the next day, he would write a note of protest, and
      Corydon would be wild with misery, and would tear up his love-notes, and
      vow in tears that he should never touch her hand again. Now and then he
      would try to suggest to her that what she needed for the fulfillment of
      her life was not a madman like himself, but a husband who would love her
      and cherish her, as other women were loved and cherished; and there was
      nothing in all the world that galled her quite so much as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. There came a time when all these happenings could no longer be
      hid from parents. This unthinkable "engagement" had to be announced, and
      the furies of grief and rage and despair unchained. No one could realize
      the change that had come over Corydon&mdash;Cory-don, the meek and
      long-suffering, who now was turned to granite, and immovable as the
      everlasting hills. As for Thyrsis, all kinds of madness had come from him,
      and were expected from him. But even he was appalled at the devastation
      which this thunderbolt caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have ruined your career! You have ruined your career!" was the cry
      that rang in his ears all day. And he knew what the world meant by this.
      Young men of talent who wished to rise in the world did not burden
      themselves with wives at the age of twenty; they waited until their
      careers were safe&mdash;and meantime, if they felt the need, they
      satisfied their passions with the daughters of the poor. And it was for
      some such "eligible man" as this that the world had been preparing
      Corydon; it was to save her for his coming that her sheltered life had
      been intended. Her beauty and tenderness would appeal to him, her
      innocence would bring a new thrill to his jaded passions; and when he
      offered his hand, there would be no whisper of what his past might have
      been, there would be no questions asked as to any vices or diseases he
      might bring with him. There would be trousseaus and flowers and
      wedding-cake, rice and white ribbons and a honeymoon-journey; and then an
      apartment in the city, or perhaps even a whole house, with a butler and a
      carriage&mdash;who could tell? With wealth pouring into the metropolis
      from North and West and South, such things fell often to beautiful and
      innocent maidens in sheltered homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here was this one, flinging herself away upon a penniless poet who
      could not support her, and did not even propose to try! "Does he mean to
      get some work?" was the question; and gently Corydon explained that they
      intended "to live as brother and sister." And that capped the climax&mdash;that
      proved stark, raving madness, if it did not prove downright knavery and
      fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, being utterly baffled and helpless with dismay, the mothers
      turned upon each other; for to each of them, the virtues of her own
      offspring being so apparent, it was clear that this hideous tragedy must
      have come from the machinations of the other. One day Thyrsis and his
      mother, walking down a road, met Corydon and her mother, upon a high hill
      where the winds blew wildly; and here they poured out their grief, and
      hurled their impeachments against the storm. To Thyrsis they assumed
      heroic proportions, they towered like queens of tragedy; in after-history
      this was known as the Meeting of the Mothers, and he likened it to the
      great contest in the Nibelungenlied between Brunhild and Kriemhild.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on top of it all, there came another calamity. In the boarding-house
      with Corydon lived some elderly ladies, who had a remarkable faculty for
      divining the evil deeds of other people. They had divined the evil deeds
      of Corydon and Thyrsis, and one of them was moved to come to Corydon's
      mother one day, and warn her lest others should divine them too. And so
      there was more agony; the discovery was made that Corydon had become a
      social outcast to all the maids and matrons of the summer population&mdash;a
      girl who went to visit a poet in his lonely cabin, and stayed until
      unknown hours of the night. And so there came to Thyrsis a note saying
      that Corydon must come no more to the cabin; and later in the day came
      Corydon herself, to bring the tidings that a telegram had come from the
      city, and that she and her mother were to leave the place the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was aflame with anger, and was for going to the nearest parson and
      having the matter settled there and then. But Corydon dissuaded him from
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been thinking it over," she said, "and it's best that I should go.
      You must finish the book&mdash;everything depends upon that, and you know
      that if I came here now you couldn't do it. But if I go away, there'll be
      nothing to disturb you. I can study meantime; and when we meet in the city
      in the fall, everything will be clear before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and put herself in his arms. "You know, dear heart," she said,
      "it won't be easy for me to go. But I'm sure it's for the best!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis saw that she was right, and so they settled it. She spent that
      day with him&mdash;their last day; and floods of tenderness welled up in
      their hearts, and the tears ran down their cheeks. It was only now that
      she was going that Thyrsis realized how precious she had become to him,
      and what a miracle of gentleness and trust she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed that here, and not in the village, was the place for their
      parting. So they poured out their love and devotion, and made their
      pledges for the future; and towards sundown he kissed her good-bye, and
      put her in the boat, and stood watching until it was a mere speck down the
      lake. Then he went back to the house, with a great cavern of loneliness in
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in spite of all resolves, he was up with the dawn next day, and
      walking to the village&mdash;he must see her once again! He went to the
      depot with her, and upon the platform they said another farewell; thereby
      putting a seal upon Corydon's damnation in the eyes of the maids and
      matrons of the summer population.

    </h3>
    <p>
      "Ten years!" she said. "How they have faded!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the creases are tight," said he; "they will be hard to read."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters! letters!" she exclaimed&mdash;"some of them sixty pages long!
      How much would they make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps a quarter of a million words," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They must be selected, and then cut, and then trimmed and pruned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will that leave any idea of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered with a simile. "You wish to convey to a man how it feels to
      pound stone for twelve hours in the sun. The only way you could really do
      it would be to take him and let him pound for twelve hours. But he
      wouldn't stand for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you let him pound for one hour," said she, with a smile.

      "I will put up a sign," he said&mdash;

    <h3>
      MY THYRSIS!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Oh, if I might only stay in a convent until you are ready to take me!
      Since I left you I find myself possessed of cravings, which, if I indulged
      them, might bring me the fate of the Maid of Neidpath!
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly I have known some miserable moments. But I am trying very hard to
      cultivate a happy, confident activity. The people here are aggressive, and
      I am afraid I have been rude, which I never like to be. I just succeeded
      in getting away from a young man who wanted to walk to the village with
      me. Do you know, it would drive me absolutely mad to talk to anyone now!
    </p>
    <p>
      My soul has only one cry, and I could sometimes go out on the
      mountain-side and scream it aloud to the winds. I fear I shall be a trifle
      wild, in fact utterly in pieces, until you come, with that wonderful
      recipe of yours for binding me together, and making me complete. I think
      of you in your house, and wish to God I were there, or out in the desert
      even, if you were with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I passed through the city I felt exactly as if I were in Hades. The
      glaring lights and the fearful rattle, the lazy, lounging men&mdash;I had
      dinner in a restaurant, in which all the people seemed to be feeding
      demons! It has been distinctly shown me why so many people have thought
      you a rude unmannerly boy! I don't know what people would think, if I had
      to be amongst them long.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have begun so many letters to you in my mind, and oh, the times I have
      told myself how much I loved you! I have read your letters and slept with
      them under my pillow, like the veriest love-lorn maiden. But all my happy
      thoughts are gone at present. It is distracting to me to have to come into
      such close contact with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, tell me, dearest one, what I shall have to do to control myself and
      preserve the peace of my soul, until I go to you forever? I must not long
      to see you, it prevents me from studying. If you might only come to me at
      one moment in the day, and give me one kiss, and then go away! You see, I
      am conducting myself in a very unwise manner&mdash;and it is necessary I
      should study! I should love to have an indomitable capacity for work, and
      eat only two meals a day, and never have to think about my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to tell you what I feel, how utterly and absolutely I am yours, and
      how any image that comes between you and me enrages me. If only you knew
      how I give myself up to you in thought, word, and deed!&mdash;My one
      reason for acting now, is that I may show you something I have done, my
      one thought is to be what you would wish me. No one, no one understands,
      or ever will, what is in your heart and in mine&mdash;to be locked there
      for ages. There I have placed all my power of love and religion and hope
      of the life that is to be. To you I give all my trust, all my worship, you
      are the one link that binds me to myself and to God. Without you I feel
      now that I should be a poor wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You give me my feeling of wholeness, of the possibility of completion,
      that I never had before. In my best and truest moments I know that with
      you I can be what I have hoped. With you before my eyes I have a grim
      resolution to conquer or die. The one thing I am sure of always is my love
      for you. It might be possible for you to stop loving me; but I, now that I
      have begun, shall continue to love you to the day I die&mdash;and after, I
      hope. I do not love you for what you can give me, I love you because you
      are you, I must love you now no matter what you are. I believe Shakespeare
      was right when he said that "love is not love which alters, when it
      alteration finds." I do not believe that a person can really love more
      than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must go to my German again and leave you. Do you love me? Do you love
      me? Do you love me?
    </p>
    <p>
      II. My dearest Corydon:
    </p>
    <p>
      I received a letter from you before dinner, and as usual had one of my
      flights of emotion, and thought of many things to write to you. Now I am
      up on the mountain-side, trying to recall them. Dearest, you are, as
      always, more precious to me. I am glad to see that you are suffering some,
      and I think that it is well that you have to be away from me for awhile,
      to fight some of your own soul's battles. You see that I am in my stern
      humor; as convinced as ever that the soul is to be deepened only by
      effort, and that the great glory of life cannot be bought or stolen, or
      even given for love, but must be earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell you what I have been doing since you left. I spent three whole
      days in the most unimaginable wretchedness; I had no hindrances like yours&mdash;only
      the most fearful burden of dullness and sloth, that had crept upon me and
      mastered me, during all the weeks that I had let myself be so upset and
      delayed. I cannot picture what I go through when I lose my self-command in
      that way, but it is like one who is tied down upon a railroad track and
      hears a train coming. He gets just as desperate as he pleases, and suffers
      anything you can imagine&mdash;but he does not get free. And always the
      book would be hanging before me, a kind of external conscience, to show me
      what I ought to have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have gotten myself out of that, by an effort that has quite worn me
      out. When I found myself at work again, I felt a kind of savage joy of
      effort, a greater power than I ever knew before. In the reckless mood that
      I had got to, it seemed to me that I could keep so forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now dearest, you must get the same unity in your life; you must
      concentrate all your faculties upon that&mdash;get for yourself that
      precious habit of being "instant in prayer", and "strenuous for the bright
      reward". As Wordsworth has it, "Brook no continuance of weak-mindedness!"
      Let it come to you with a pang that hurts you, that for one minute you
      have been idle, that you have admitted to yourself that life is a thing of
      no consequence, and that you do not care for it. I shall have to talk to
      you that way&mdash;perhaps not so often as I do to myself, because I do
      not think you are really in your heart such a very dull and sodden
      creature as I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the greatest trial we shall have will be our fondness for each
      other, and the possibility of being satisfied simply to hold each other in
      our arms. But we shall get the better of that, as of everything else; and
      that is not the problem now. You must learn to strive, learn to master
      yourself; you must prove your power so. Do not care how rude you have to
      be to those people; look upon the things about you as a kind of
      dream-world, and know that your own soul's life is the one real thing for
      you. And don't write any more about how circumstances hold you back. When
      you have got to work you will know that you are given your soul for no
      purpose but to fight circumstances; that they are the things to make you
      fight. When they are removed, as I know to my cost, there is still the
      same necessity of fighting; only it is like a horse who has to win a race
      without the spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must talk to yourself about this, night and day, until this desire is
      so awake in you that you can't go idle many moments without its rushing
      into your mind, and giving you a kind of electric shock. And when that
      happens you fling aside every thing else, every idea but the work that you
      ought to be doing, and put all your faculties upon that; and every time
      that you catch them wandering, you do the same thing again, and again.
      Some times when I become very keenly aware of myself, and of what a
      shallow creature I really am, it seems to me that it is only by wearing
      myself out in that grim and savage way that I can make myself even
      tolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>must</i> stop. Do you know that for five precious hours by my watch I
      have sat up here thinking about you and writing to you? Dear me&mdash;and
      I am tired, and frozen, for there is a cold wind. I shall have, I see, to
      prove some of <i>my</i> powers, by not writing letters to you when I
      should be at the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see that it takes four or five days for letters to come and go between
      us; and so if we write often, our letters will be crossing. Four or five
      days is time enough for us to change our moods a dozen times, so our
      correspondence will be apt to be complicated!
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. MY DEAREST THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      It has worried me somewhat to-day that you might be utterly disappointed
      in the letter I wrote you. It was a wild jumble of words, but I was
      fighting all sorts of uncomfortable things within me. To-day I have been
      anything but despairing, and have "gone at" the German. In fact, I quite
      lost myself in it, and believe I understand thoroughly the construction of
      the first poem. Wonderful accomplishment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your words, as I read them again, dear heart, are full of a great beauty
      and fire and energy, and I only hope you may keep them always. I believe
      that the possibility of the marriage we both desire, depends greatly if
      not entirely on <i>your</i> sternness. You must realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell with the proper conditions and training what energy I might
      be able to accumulate for myself, but in the meanwhile the thing that
      makes me most wretched is my utter incapacity at times, and my inability
      to share with you your work. In my weaker and more helpless moods, I ask
      myself with a pang, whether I ought to go with you at all, when I cannot
      help you. But I must stop fuming. I have come out of my mudpuddle for good
      and for all, and that is the main consideration. I don't intend to go
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not think of each other in any way but as co-workers in a great
      labor; we must simply know that our love is rooted deeply, and the harder
      we work the more firm it will be. There is no reason why we should not go
      to the altar with just this sternness, and from now on preserve this
      attitude until the day when we have earned the right to consider what love
      means. Can you do it? I will prove to you that I can.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV. MY DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am trying very dreadfully, and go away alone and pound at the German as
      if my life depended upon it. I go to bed every night with a tight feeling
      in my head, but I do not mind, as I take it for a guarantee that I have
      not rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      And oh, my dearest, dearest and best, I am trying not to think of you too
      much&mdash;that is too much in a way that does not help me to study. But I
      love you really, yes, truly, and I know I would follow you anywhere. I am
      not particularly joyful, but then I do not expect to be for a great many
      years.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Only a few words. I have been hovering to-day between spurts of hopeful
      energy, and the most indescribable despair. It positively freezes my
      heart, and I have been on the point of writing to you and telling you to
      relieve yourself of the responsibility of me. The reason is because it
      seems a perfectly Herculean task to read "Egmont". I have to look up words
      in the dictionary until I am absolutely so weary I care not about
      anything; and then I think of you, and what you are able to do, and at one
      word from you I would give up all idea of marrying you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you I am up and down in this mood. Great God, I could work all day
      and all night if I could do what you do, but to strain at iron fetters&mdash;a
      snail! Oh, I cannot tell you&mdash;I simply groan under it. At such times
      I have no more idea of marrying you than of journeying to the moon. I
      repeat to you, to be constantly choked back, while you are rapidly
      advancing, will kill me. I don't know what you will say to this, but it is
      intolerable, unendurable, to me. When I think of your ability and mine, I
      simply laugh about it&mdash;Thyrsis, it is simply ridiculous. I do not ask
      you to take me with you, Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you wonder at my writing all this? You would not if you understood. It
      is so hard for me to keep any joy in my heart, and I get tired of repeated
      failures, that is all. I thought I must write you this, and have it over
      with. This is the style of letter I have always torn up, but this time it
      goes. I think I will practice the piano now, and try to get some gladness
      into my soul again.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI. MY DEAR, DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is a dreadful sort of letter which I wrote you last night which I
      haven't sent you yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been studying, or trying to most of the day, and my mind has
      wandered most painfully. There were two days in which I seemed to have
      hold of myself, but with an effort that was a fearful strain. I must try
      so, that it almost kills me, if I wish to accomplish even a little of what
      I ought. The heat here is almost insupportable, it is stifling, and I
      spent an hour or so in the water this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the thought is always torture to me&mdash;that you are accomplishing
      so much more than I! I was thinking of your letters to-night, and I
      recalled some words that seemed to speak more of your love for me. Oh,
      Thyrsis, if your letters are fiery and passionate, is it for love of <i>me</i>
      that they are? I'm almost afraid at times, when I read your letters&mdash;when
      you tell me of the kind of woman you <i>want</i> to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I at present am certainly not she. And do you know that when we are
      married we shall be united forever? I don't know why I write you these
      things, they are not at all inspiring thoughts to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I was able to go in swimming this afternoon, and forget everything
      and frolic around as happily as any water-baby!
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII. MY DEAR CORYDON:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I came off to write my poem, but I have been thinking about you, and I
      must write a long letter. It is one of the kind that you do not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, you complain of the contradictions in my letters. I am
      sorry. I live so, struggling always with what is not best in me, and
      continually falling down. Also, in this matter I am an utter stranger,
      groping my way; and there is an element of passion in it, a dangerous
      element, which leads me continually astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can only say that in my ideal of love, which is utter love and spiritual
      love, I think of living my life with you in entire nakedness of soul.
      Therefore, I shall always be before you exactly as I should be by myself.
      And I shall write you now exactly what I have been thinking, what is hard
      and unkind in it, as well as the rest. You will learn to know me as a man
      far from perfect, often going astray himself, often feeling wrong things,
      often leading you astray and making you wretched. But behind all this
      there is the thing often lost sight of, but always present&mdash;the iron
      duty that I have, and the force in me which drives me to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this morning I have been thinking of my book, losing myself in it and
      filling myself with its glory. This afternoon I fell to thinking about us;
      and thoughts which have been lurking in my mind for a long time got the
      upper hand for the first time. They were that I did not love you as I
      ought to, that I could not; that the love which I felt was a thing from my
      own heart, and that it had carried me away because I was anxious to
      persuade myself I had found my ideal upon earth; that you <i>could</i> not
      satisfy the demands upon life that I made, and that if I married you it
      would be to make you wretched, and myself as well; that you had absolutely
      nothing of the things that I needed, and that the life which your nature
      required was entirely different from mine; that you had no realization of
      the madness that was driving me, could find and give me none of the power
      I needed; and that I ought to write and tell you this, no matter what it
      cost&mdash;that I owed it to the sacred possibility of my own soul, to
      live alone if I could live better alone. And when I had said these words,
      I felt a sense of relief, because they were haunting me, and had been for
      a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      How they will affect you I cannot tell, it depends upon deep your love for
      me is; certainly they mean for me that <i>my</i> love is not deep, that
      you have not made yourself necessary to me. I think that in that last
      phrase I put the whole matter in its essence&mdash;you have not <i>bound</i>
      yourself to me; I am always struggling to keep my love firm and right, to
      hold myself to you. The result is that there is no food for my soul in the
      thought of our love, in my thought of you; and therefore, I am continually
      dissatisfied and doubting, continually feeling the difference between the
      love I have dreamed and our love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to think the matter out, and get to the very bottom of it. The
      first thing that came to me on the other side was your absolute <i>truth</i>;
      your absolute devotion to what was right and noble in our ideal. So that,
      as I was thinking, I suddenly stopped short with this statement&mdash;"If
      you cannot find right love with that girl, it must be because you do not
      honor love, or care for it." And then I thought of your helplessness, of
      your lack of training and opportunity for growth; and I told myself how
      absurd it was of me to expect satisfying love from you&mdash;when all that
      I knew about in life, and thought of, was entirely unknown to you. I
      realized that I was a man who had tasted more or less of all knowledge,
      and had an infinite vision of knowledge yet before him, and an infinite
      hunger for it; and that you were a school-girl, with all of a
      school-girl's tasks on your hands. So I said to myself that the reason for
      the dissatisfaction was a fault of my own, that it had come from my own
      blindness. I had gone wrong in my attitude to you; I had failed in my
      sternness and my high devotion to perfection; I had contented myself with
      lesser things, had come down from my best self, and had failed to make you
      see what a task was before you, if you ever meant to know my best self.
      You perceive that this is a return to my old-time attitude; I am sorry if
      it makes you wretched, but I cannot help it. It is a surgical operation
      that must be borne. I shall not make it necessary again, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, dear Corydon, I am not trying to choose pleasant words in this
      letter, this is the way I talk to <i>myself</i>. And if anything good
      comes from our love, it will be because of this letter. I challenge what
      is noblest in you to rise to meet the truth of it. I should not care to
      write to you if I did not feel that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have had a possibility offered to you, and because you are very hungry
      for life you have clasped it to you, placed all your happiness in it. The
      possibility is the love of a man whose heart has been filled with the fire
      of genius. There are few men whom life takes hold of as it does me, who
      sacrifice themselves for their duty as I do, who demand <i>experience</i>&mdash;knowledge,
      power, beauty&mdash;as I do. There are very few men who will wrest out of
      existence as much as I will, or know and have as much of life. I am a boy
      just now, and only beginning to live; but I have my purpose in hand, and I
      know that if I am given health and life, there is nothing that men have
      known that I shall not know, nothing that is done in the world that I
      shall not do, or try to. I have a strong physique, and I labor day and
      night, and always shall. I shall always be hungry and restless, always
      dissatisfied with myself, and with everything about me, and acting and
      feeling most of the time like a person haunted by a devil. I make no
      apologies to you for the conceit of what I am saying; it is what I think
      of myself, without caring what other people think. I know that I have a
      tremendous temperament, tremendous powers hidden within me, and they have
      got to come out. When they do, the world will know what I know now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Corydon, as you understand, I dream love absolute, and would scorn any
      other kind. I can master my passion, if it be that upon earth there is no
      woman willing or able to go with me to the last inch of my journey. I
      dream a life-companion to follow wherever my duty drives me; to feel all
      the desperateness of desire that I feel, to be stern and remorseless as I
      must be, wild and savage as I must be; to race through knowledge with me
      and to share my passion for truth with me; a woman with whom I need have
      no shame in the duty of my genius! As I tell you, if I marry you, I expect
      to give myself to you as your own heart; and then I think of the gentle
      and mild existence you have led!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very hard for me even to tell about my life, or to explain this
      thing that drives me mad. But I am writing this letter to you for the
      purpose of making clear to you that there are two alternatives before you,
      and that you must choose one or the other and stick by it, and bear the
      consequences. It is painful to me to think that I have fascinated you by
      what opportunities I have, even by what power and passion and talents I
      have, and filled you with a hunger for me&mdash;when really you do not
      realize at all what I am, or what I must be, and when what I have to do
      will terrify you. I write in the thought of terrifying you <i>now</i>, and
      making you give up this red-hot iron that you are trying to hold on to; or
      else to show you my life so plainly that never afterwards can you blame
      me, or shrink back except by your own fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not blame me for writing these words, for wondering if a woman,
      if <i>any</i> woman has power to stand what I need to do. And when I talk
      to you about giving me up, you must not think that is cold, but know that
      it is my faithfulness to my vision, which is the one thing to which I owe
      any duty in the world. Nor is it right that you should expect to be
      essential to me, when I have labored to be all to myself. You could become
      necessary to me in the years to come; if I marry you to-day I shall marry
      you for what you are to become, and for that <i>alone</i>&mdash;at any
      rate if I am true to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are to be my wife you are to be my soul&mdash;to live my soul's
      life and bear its pain. You are to understand that I talk to you as I talk
      to myself, call you the names I call myself, and if you cry, give you up
      in disgust; that I am to deny you all pleasure as I do myself, and what
      God knows will be ten thousand times harder, let you take pleasure, and
      then spring up in the very midst of it&mdash;you know what I mean! That I
      am to be ever dissatisfied with you, ever inconsiderate of your feelings,
      and ever declaring that you are failing! That however much I may love you,
      I am to be your conscience, and therefore keep you&mdash;just about as you
      are now, miserable! You told me that you would gladly be whipped to learn
      to live; and this can be the only thing to happen to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must understand why I act in this way. I am a weak and struggling man,
      with a thousand temptations; and when I marry you, you will be the
      greatest temptation of all. You are a beautiful girl, and I love you, and
      every instinct of my nature drives me to you; for me to live with you
      without kissing you or putting my arms about you, will remain always
      difficult. It will be so for you, as for me, and it will always be our
      danger, and always make us wretched. Your soul rises in you as I write
      this, and you say (as you've said before) that if I offered to kiss you
      after it, it would be an insult. But only wait until we meet!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the one thing that has become clear to me: just as soon as there
      comes the least thought of satisfaction in our love, just so soon does it
      cease to satisfy my best self. You cannot satisfy my best self, you do not
      even know it; and if it were a question of that, I should never dream of
      marrying you! I love you for this and for this alone&mdash;because you are
      an undeveloped soul, the dream of whose infinite possibilities is my one
      delight in the matter. I think that you are <i>perfect</i> in character,
      that you are truth itself; and therefore, no matter how helpless you may
      be, I have no fear of failing to make you "all the world to me", provided
      only that I am not false to my ideal. You must know from what I have
      written before that I <i>can</i> love, that I do know what love is, and
      that you may trust me. I am not trying to degrade passion&mdash;I simply
      see how passion throws the burden on the woman, and therefore it is
      utterly a crime with us&mdash;the least thought of it! I ought to consider
      you as a school-girl, really just that; and instead of that I write you
      love letters!
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you there is nothing more hateful for me to look back upon than
      that childish business of ours, that time when we went upstairs that we
      might kiss each other unseen. I tell you, it revolts my soul, from love
      and from you! I should be perfectly willing to take all the blame&mdash;I
      do; only I have led you to like that (or to act as if you did) and I must
      stop it. Can you not understand how hateful it is to me to think of making
      you anything that I should be disgusted with?
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect you to read over this letter until you realize that it is, every
      word of it, completely true and noble, and until you can write me so. You
      and I are to feel ourselves two school-children and live just so. It is
      not usual for school-children to marry, but that we dare upon the strength
      of our purpose, and in defiance of all counsel, and of every precedent. We
      are to feel that we owe our duty to our ideal; and that simply <i>because</i>
      of the strength and passion of our love for each other, we demand
      perfection, each of the other. My setting this stern challenge before you
      is nothing but my determination to give you my right love, to demand that
      you be a perfect woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise you therefore no quarter; I shall make no sacrifice of my ideal
      for your sake. As I wrote you, I mean to be absolutely one with you, and I
      expect you to be the same. You shall have (if you wish it) all of my soul&mdash;I
      shall live my life with you and think all my thoughts aloud&mdash;study to
      give you <i>everything</i> that I have. And God only, who knows my heart,
      knows what utter love for you lies in those words, what utter trust of you&mdash;how
      I think of you as being purity and holiness itself. To offer to take any
      other being into my soul, to lay bare all the secret places of it to its
      gaze, all the weaknesses as well as all the strength, and all that is vain
      as well as all that is sacred! You cannot know how I feel about my heart,
      but this you may know, that no one else has had a glimpse of it, you are
      the first and the last; and so sure am I of you that I dare to say it, <i>all</i>
      my life will I live in your presence, and trust to your sympathy and truth&mdash;and
      feel that I am false to love if I do not. If there were anything in my
      heart so foul that I feared to speak of it, I should give you that first,
      as the sacrifice of love; or any vanity or foible&mdash;such things are
      really hardest to have others know, so great is our conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could talk to you to-night, I should do just as I did up on the hill
      in the moonlight&mdash;frighten you, and make you wonder if there was <i>any</i>
      woman who wished to bear such a burden; and perhaps the saddest thing of
      all to me is that I do not bear it&mdash;instead I bear the gnawing of a
      conscience bitter and ashamed of itself. And could you bear <i>that</i>
      burden? For Corydon, as I look at myself to-night, I am before God, a
      coward and a dastard! I have not done my work! I have not borne the pain
      He calls me to bear, I have not wrested out the strength He put in my
      secret heart! And here I am chattering, <i>talking</i> about work to you!
      And these things are like a nightmare to me; they turn all my life's
      happiness to gall. And you are taking upon yourself this same burden&mdash;coming
      to help me to get rid of it. Or if you do not wish to, for God's sake, and
      mine, and yours, don't come near me&mdash;you have come too near as it is!
      Can you not see that when I am face to face with these fearful things&mdash;and
      you come and ask me to give my life to you, to worship you with the best
      faculties I possess&mdash;that I have no right to say yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      You once told me you were happy because I called you "mein guter Geist,
      mein bess'res Ich"; well, you are not in the least that. The name that I
      give you, and that you may keep, is "the beautiful possibility of a soul".
      Remember a phrase I told you at the very beginning of our love, of the
      peril of "ceasing to love perfection and coming to love a woman." And read
      Shelley's sad note to "Epipsychidion"!
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. Dear Corydon:
    </p>
    <p>
      You tell me in your last letter that you are leaving all who love you; and
      you ask "How do you know that because you love beauty, you will love <i>me</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been thinking a good deal about this; I do not believe, Corydon,
      that a man more haunted by the madness of desire ever lived upon earth
      than I. And when I get at the essence of myself, I do not believe that I
      am a kind man; I think that a person with less patience for human hearts
      never existed, perhaps with less feeling. There is only one thing in the
      world that I can be sure of, or that you can, my fidelity to my ideal! I
      know that however often I may fail or weaken, however many mistakes I may
      make, my hunger for the things of the soul will <i>never</i> leave me, and
      that night and day I shall work for them. I do not believe I have the
      right to promise you anything else, I have no right to dream of anything
      else; this is not my pleasure, as I feel it, it is a frenzy, it is that to
      which some blind and nameless and merciless impulse drives me. And I may
      try to persuade myself all my life that I love you, Corydon, and nothing
      else, and want nothing else; and all the time in the depths of my heart I
      hear these words from my conscience&mdash;"You are a fool." I love power,
      I love life, and seek them and strive for them, and care for nothing else
      and never have; and nothing else can satisfy me. And I cannot give any
      other love than this, any other promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX. My dear Corydon:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been taking a walk this morning, thinking about us, and that I had
      treated you fearfully. The whole truth of it all is this&mdash;that I am
      so raw and so young and so helpless (and you are as much, if not more so)
      that I cannot, to save my life, be sure if my love for you is what it
      ought to be, or even if I could love any one as I ought. And I am so
      wretchedly dissatisfied! Do you know that for two weeks I have been trying
      to write a passage of my book&mdash;and before God, I <i>cannot!</i> I
      have not the power, I have not the life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Corydon, it comes to me that you are <i>miserable</i> to be in love
      with me&mdash;that I had no right to put this burden on your shoulders. I
      would say better things if I could, but I think that our marriage will be
      a setting out across a wild ocean in the dark! It is for you to be the
      heroine, to dare the voyage if you choose. These sound like wild words,
      but they are the truth of my life, and I dare not say any others. Can a
      girl who has been brought up in gentleness and sweetness, in innocence of
      life and of pain&mdash;can she say things, feel things like these?
    </p>
    <p>
      X. Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      God did not endow me with your tongue, or else it would not be the great
      effort it is to me to tell you some of the thoughts that have rushed
      through my mind in the last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an hour since I began to read your letter of Horrible Truth. Now it
      seems to me it might have been in the last year, in the last century.
      Actually I feel like a stranger to myself; and my movements are very slow.
      First, I will tell you that I believe in God, oh, so implicitly&mdash;this
      thought gives me infinite hope. I long to let you know as much of my heart
      as I can, if I am to be your life-companion, as I firmly believe I am to
      be. I have such a strange calmness now, and I imagine that I must feel
      very much the way Rip Van Winkle did when he awoke. I want to try to show
      you my heart&mdash;it is right that I should try, is it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Know that I have placed much faith and trust in you, in anything that you
      did. If you opened one door to me and told me it led to the great and
      permanent truth, I believed you absolutely. If you hauled me back and put
      me through an opposite one, telling me that there my road lay, I believed
      you with equal faith. Now, now, at the end of an hour, I am, through you,
      convinced of one door, the only and true entrance; and I am as sure as I
      am that the sun is shining at this moment, that nothing in God's world can
      ever again make me lose sight of it. I have found that <i>you</i> can lose
      sight of it, Thyrsis,&mdash;something shows me that I have in the last
      month been more right than you. Yes, I have, Thyrsis, though you may not
      know it. And the reason I couldn't stay right was because I am not strong
      enough to grasp my good impulses, and keep hold of them: because I have
      not enough faith in the soul within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to tell you what I have felt since reading your letter. All is
      so disgustingly calm in me now. But listen, I believe I have had a little
      glimpse this afternoon of what it is to <i>feel</i>; and because of that
      knowledge I now am not afraid to tell you that I claim something of God
      and life&mdash;that I can get it if you can. This has been very strong in
      me at moments, but, as I tell you, I have not yet learned to hold my
      glimpses of truth&mdash;they seem to come to me, and as quickly disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to read your letter, and I cannot describe to you the convulsion
      that came over me. It seemed that I had the feeling of an empty skull on a
      desert; such a feeling&mdash;you can never have it! All the horror and
      despair! I tried to form my thoughts and tell myself it was not true. I
      tried to pray, and I did pray&mdash;out loud&mdash;and asked God to give
      me strength to read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use all the penetration I was capable of, to find out one
      thing, whether you were purely and unreservedly sincere in it. I wondered
      whether you really wished to live your life alone, but could not find the
      courage to tell me so. I firmly believe that no failure in the future, no
      disgust or helplessness, could ever bring me the complete anguish of those
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you realize what such a thing meant to me, Thyrsis?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last spring, I had succeeded in bringing myself into an almost complete
      state of coma&mdash;I saw that I could do nothing, and because I would not
      endure such profitless pain I drugged myself to sleep. And you, you fiend,
      waked me up; and may your soul be thrice cursed if you have only pulled
      the doll to pieces <i>to see what it was made of!</i> Know, you that have
      a soul which says it lives and suffers&mdash;that I can't go to sleep
      again! There is no joy for me in mother or father, in friends or
      admiration&mdash;I can tolerate nothing that I tolerated before you came
      with your cursed or blessed fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if you do not marry me, or if I do not find some man who has your
      strength and desire for life, and who will take me and help me to learn, I
      shall die without having lived.&mdash;And I cried out in misery&mdash;only
      forty-two years, only forty-two little years, and I shall be an old woman
      of sixty! Only forty-two years in which to learn to live!
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe if I had you here now I could almost strangle you. We may kill
      each other some day. I sometimes feel that there is nothing that will give
      me any relief, that I cannot breathe, I cannot support my body. But these
      are foolish and unprofitable feelings&mdash;and I believe I will yet be
      saved, if not by you, perhaps by myself. I think some heavenly aid came to
      me to-day. I asked for it, I simply said it <i>must</i> come&mdash;and now
      I am able to bear myself and look around me, and say that the secret of my
      liberation is not death but life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please realize, Thyrsis, that I know you do not need me, that I cannot
      either entertain you or help you. My dear, do you not know that I have
      been conscious of this from the very beginning&mdash;and it has been this
      thought that has often made me worry, and doubt, and question. And then I
      have told myself that you had found <i>something</i> in me to love; and
      that I also was very hungry to know about life and God; and that if you
      loved me enough to believe I was not dross, we might, with our untiring
      devotion&mdash;well, we might be right in going with each other. And now&mdash;would
      you rather I should tell you I will not marry you, be my desire, or
      effort, what it may? I do not know&mdash;even though I want to live so
      terribly. I have no word, no proof to give!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Thyrsis, I have no more strength to write. I only wish I had some
      power to make you know what I have felt this afternoon&mdash;I think if I
      could, you would have no more doubt of me. And I believe it is my
      God-given right not to doubt myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will write no more&mdash;I have written enough to make you answer one of
      two things. "Come with me," or, "I would rather go alone." I know which
      one it will be, even now in my wretchedness. The sky is so blue this
      evening, and everything is so beautiful&mdash;and I am trying so hard to
      be right, to feel strong and confident!
    </p>
    <p>
      XI. Dear Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just arisen. I woke in the middle of the night, and there was a
      spectre sitting by my bedside to frighten me; he succeeded at first, but I
      managed finally to get rid of him, and to find some peace. Many of your
      sentences came to me, and I was able to get behind the words, and I saw
      plainly that the letters were just what you should have written, and that
      they could not but benefit me. They have accomplished their purpose, I
      believe&mdash;they are burned into my soul, and have placed me rightly in
      our relation. I shall simply never trust the permission you may give me,
      in the future, to rest or be satisfied. I shall only hate you, for the
      pain of some of your words I shall <i>never</i> forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of the first two pages of your letter will always put me in
      mortal terror of you. For the rest, I am very grateful, and I will try to
      show you how I love your ideal. I can never repay you as long as I live
      for letting me come with you. Oh Thyrsis, I am sure that I will never
      think or care whether you love me or not, if only I may go with you and
      learn how to strive!
    </p>
    <p>
      I tore up all your love-letters this morning. I kept the last letter&mdash;though
      I do not think I could bear to read it over. I should be afraid of again
      going through with that despair. Oh, I beg for the time when I shall be
      obliged to waste none of my minutes&mdash;and when I shall have no
      opportunity of writing you! What <i>time</i> I have spent over your
      letters and mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. Dear Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am restlessly waiting for the supper-bell to ring, and my head is aching
      intensely, and I am generally topsy-turvy. Alas! alas! the distance that
      separates us and our understanding!
    </p>
    <p>
      I received a letter to-day while I was studying&mdash;but said I would not
      open it for a week, that I wanted strength to study. Well, I studied all
      the afternoon and found it none too easy. When I came home, I thought
      perhaps it was better to read your letter, which I grimly did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, you are keeping me on the rack, literally on the rack, and my
      flesh and blood do not seem to be able to stand it&mdash;my body seems to
      be the organ that first fails me, my brain is never so tired as my body. I
      love to think that you are not less merciful to me than you would be to
      yourself, I feel that you could not have used more cruel whips to
      yourself. Do you suppose that any disgust, scolding, or malediction to me
      could, as your wife, hurt me, as your doubt of me hurts me now?
    </p>
    <p>
      And I just begin to read your letter again, and I tell you, you are a
      fool. You say you do not know whether you could love any one as you ought&mdash;well,
      I, with all my weakness, know whether <i>I</i> can love, and I love you a
      thousand times more than you have given me cause to. And you are so <i>hungry!</i>
      Will you always starve because you are blind? As to being <i>satisfied,</i>
      how could you be? But you say you will love me as much as I deserve. How
      much do I deserve&mdash;do you know? I sometimes cry out against you and
      long to get hold of you. If you have genius, why doesn't it give you some
      inkling whether you are a man with a heart, not only a stupid boy? And
      then I see it all plainly, or think I do, and know that you are trying so
      hard to be right towards us, because you think you love me the way other
      people love; and you know if I am weak, it would degrade your genius; and
      you cannot be sure of my character or strength. You cannot know whether I
      realize the life I am selecting&mdash;you have found it hard, and you have
      every reason to think that I will find it ten times harder; and you love
      me in a way that is not the highest,&mdash;but yet you love me enough,
      thank God, to tell me the whole truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have come to a pass where I can say to myself with truth, that I do not
      care how much or how little you love me. That depends upon <i>you</i>, as
      well as myself. I believe the time will come, when you will love me as you
      ought, and I say this in perfect calm conviction, in all my weakness, and
      with all my maudlin habits clinging to me. Strangely enough your doubt of
      me has made me rise up in arms to champion my cause, or else I should lie
      down forever in the dust, and deny my God.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder whether it is my love for you that makes me believe? I cling to
      you, as a mother might cling to her child; I cling to you as the
      embodiment, the promise, of all I will ever find true in life. I look to
      live in you, to fulfil all my possibilities in you, and if you die or
      forsake me, all my hope is gone, and I am dead. This is a letter in which
      I have no scorn or doubt, or ridicule of myself, as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then you ask me, "Can a girl brought up in gentleness and sweetness,
      and innocence of life and of pain, can she say things, feel things like
      these?" It is the gentleness and sweetness and innocence that are galling
      to me. I can tolerate no more of them. They have warped me, they have
      given me no chance. But I have had some pain in my life, and since I have
      known you I have known more about pain and what it brings, and leaves.&mdash;And
      now I am feeling ill, and I cannot control that. Oh, God!
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII. Dearest Corydon:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a chance to finish the first part of my book to-day, and save
      myself from Hades; and here I am writing to you&mdash;just a line. (Of
      course it turned out to be six pages!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Your last letter was very noble; I can only say to you, that the treatment
      which makes you upbraid me is not done for <i>my</i> sake; that the life
      which I live is not lived for <i>my</i> sake. You say perhaps you are
      better than I; it is very possible&mdash;I often think so myself; but that
      is nothing to the point. I should be very wretched if I sat down to think
      what I am. Oblige me by being better than my ideal&mdash;if you can! You
      must understand, dearest, that behind all that I am doing, there is truth
      to the soul; and that truth to the soul is love, and the only love. I am
      seeking for nothing but the privilege of treating you as myself; and rest
      assured, that if I treat you any differently it will be better than I
      treat myself! There is no peril in our life except that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some day you will understand that I can sometimes feel about myself that I
      am utterly hateful, utterly false, utterly shallow and <i>bad</i>; and
      that to get away from myself would be all that I desire in life. I cannot
      imagine my having such opinion of you; but some dissatisfaction&mdash;just
      a little&mdash;I may have. Only let us love perfection, you and I, with
      all our souls, and I think our love for each other may safely be allowed
      to take care of itself. Remember the two ships in Clough's poem, which
      parted, but sailed by the compass, and reached the same port.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall spend no more time comforting you about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      And dear Corydon, when you are angry at my doubting your power, and say
      that I do not know you, I can only reply&mdash;Why of course I don't, and
      neither do you. You find your own self out little by little&mdash;why get
      angry with me because I don't know it until you tell me? You are a grown
      woman compared to what you were three months ago; and this character that
      you ask me to know&mdash;well, it takes years of hard labor to prove a
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV. Dearest Corydon:
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you ever realize how much <i>faith</i> in you I have? As utterly
      different is your whole life, as if you had been in another world; and
      through all the wilderness that I have travelled, I hope to drag you. But
      I cannot carry you, or take you; I must trust in the frenzy of your grip
      upon me. There is nothing else you could have that I would trust. You
      might be wonderfully clever and wonderfully wise&mdash;and I could do
      nothing with you. Do you remember Beethoven's saying, that he would like
      to take a certain woman, if he had time, and marry her and break her
      heart, so that she might be able to sing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah dear heart, I wish you could read in my words what I feel! I wonder if
      I am dreaming when I live in this ideal of what a woman's love can be&mdash;so
      complete and so utter a surrender, so complete a forgetting, a losing of
      the self, so complete a living in another heart! I am not afraid to ask
      just this from a woman&mdash;from you! For I have enough heart's passion
      to satisfy every thirst that you may feel. Ah, Corydon, I want you! I am
      drunk with the thought of <i>making</i> a woman to love. I wonder if any
      man ever thought of that before! Artists go about the world with the great
      hunger of their hearts, and expecting to find by chance another soul like
      the one they have spent years in making beautiful and swift and strong;
      but has anyone ever thought that instead of writing books that no one
      understands, he might be making another kind of an artwork&mdash;one that
      would be alive, and with sacred possibilities of its own?
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Your last letters have been very beautiful. I see one thing&mdash;though
      you inform me that you believe you are a hard man, your natural gentleness
      and sympathy of heart would be the ruin of both of us in the future if I
      would permit it. But I think you can trust me, not ever as long as I live
      to lead you into weakness. My desperateness, before I received your letter
      saying that I might come with you, was rather dreadful; it made me doubt
      myself, for it was so difficult to keep myself from going to pieces. I
      have been wicked enough, to wonder whether I could ever make you feel as I
      felt for two days&mdash;if I could only bring to your heart that one pang,
      the only real one I ever felt in my life! But it taught me one thing, that
      the only road toward realization of life and one's self is through
      suffering. I found out that I could bear, for it seems to me as I look
      back at that horrible nightmare, that it was almost by a superhuman effort
      I was able to read the letter at all. But enough of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I have effectually cured myself of any weak yearning for your
      love. I go to you in gratefulness, knowing what I lack and what you need.
      Anything my love can do for you, it shall do. It may have some power&mdash;I
      sometimes think that it could have more than you realize.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose every woman has thought that the man she loved was her very
      life, but I do not think it of you, I simply <i>know</i> it. I must go
      with you, whether I loved you or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile my love has assumed a strength to me that I never felt before. I
      don't know how my wild and incoherent letters have affected you, but there
      were many times when I longed to get hold of you, literally, and simply
      shake into you some recognition of my soul. Oh, I am afraid you couldn't
      get away from me; the more merciless you are to me, the wilder I get.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am possessed by so many opposite moods and influences. I am afraid of
      you a little. I never know what you are going to do to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel, I cannot help but feel, that I am part of your life, now, you
      could not neglect me any more than you could your own soul. I consider you
      just as responsible for mine as you are for your own. I say this with no
      doubts, but know that it is true, and you must know it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      You certainly have a wonderful task in store for me, and I pray God to
      give me strength for it. I can see very plainly that you expect to find
      the essence of my soul better than yours, because it seems that you are
      making my task harder than yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, I have actually found myself asking, at times, with a certain
      defiant rage&mdash;if you were actually going to give love to your
      princess before you had made her suffer! So far you have not made her
      suffer at all. I had become quite excited over this idea&mdash;though
      perhaps I had no right to. I suppose it is all right, because she is an
      imaginary person, and you can endow her with all the perfections you
      please. She is triumphant and thrilling, and worthy of love&mdash;whereas
      I am just little Corydon, whom you have known all your life, and who is
      stupid and helpless, and impossible to imagine romances about! Is that the
      way of it?

      XVII. MY DEAREST THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A long letter has just come to me. I always receive your letters with many
      palpitations, and by the time I get through reading, my cheeks are
      flaming. It is too bad it takes letters so long to go to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have finally come to bear the attitude towards myself, that I would to a
      naughty child. I will have no nonsense, and all my absurdities and
      inefficiencies <i>must</i> be cured. I think I have come to know myself a
      little better within the last few days. I know that I have no right to
      quick victories, or any happiness at all, even your love. I tell you
      truly, if it were only possible, I would go away this minute&mdash;do you
      hear?&mdash;oh! to some lonely place, and then I would do something with
      myself. I want to be alone, alone&mdash;I want to be face to face with
      myself, and God, if possible! I have come to the conclusion that I can do
      anything I must do. I think (I am not sure) I could give you up, if I were
      obliged to, and go away by myself and try alone. If I do not have you, I
      must have solitude.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVIII. MY DEAREST CORYDON:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thinking about my work this morning, and how hard it was, and how much
      strength it would take, my thoughts turned to you, and I discovered, as
      never before, just how I like to think of you. It seemed to me that you
      were part of the raw material that I had to use; that I had mastered you,
      and was going to make you what you had to be. And there woke in my heart
      at those words a fierceness of purpose that I had never felt in my life
      before&mdash;I was quite mad with it; and you cried out to escape me, but
      I would not let you go, but held you right tightly in my arms. And so&mdash;I
      do not mean to let you go! I shall bear you away with me, and make you
      what I wish. And the promise of marriage that I make you is just this: not
      that I love you&mdash;I do not love you; but what I wish the woman to be
      whom I am to love&mdash;that I will make you!
    </p>
    <p>
      And do not ever dare to ask me for any other promise, for you will not get
      it. You will come with this.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIX. MY THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I had an <i>iron grip</i> at my heart just now, as I was trying to study.
      I had a foreboding of something&mdash;and then I came home and found your
      letter telling me I was yours, and I <i>must.</i> At last I may go to you
      the way I wish! My love, my love, I do not care what you are, or what you
      do to me, as long as I may go with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I laugh at myself as I say it! You have mastered me to worship your <i>life</i>&mdash;not
      you. I shall not work for your love, I shall work to live. Our love will
      be one of the incidents of our life. Meanwhile, I may go with you, that is
      all that I say&mdash;I sing it. I may go with you, not to happiness, but
      to necessity!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that cursed German! It hangs over my head like a sword of Damocles
      I have heard of&mdash;though I don't know why it was held over his head!
    </p>
    <p>
      You think our love was settling into the cooing state! Dear me, Thyrsis, I
      hope I will not always have to yell to you over a foggy ocean!
    </p>
    <h3>
      XX. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Can you imagine what it must be to be shut up in a little room on a rainy
      night, with the children and people screaming under your window? That is
      my position now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find myself hard to manage at times. I want to become discouraged or
      melancholy or disgusted, but I drive myself better than I used to. I even
      was happy a little for a few moments to-night. I was playing one of my
      piano-pieces, and I found myself imagining all sorts of things. But this
      happens very seldom, and only lasts for a moment. I often wonder at
      myself. Two months ago I did not love you one particle; I love you now, so
      that&mdash;so that it is impossible for me to do anything else. In fact I
      did not realize how much I loved you until that terrible moment when I
      read you did not love me. I saw how impossible it will be to cease to love
      you, no matter what you do to me. I do not know <i>why</i> it is; I simply
      know it is, and perhaps some day I may teach <i>you</i> how to love. I do
      not imagine you know how very well, at present&mdash;no, Thyrsis, I don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know your true self now, and I love it better than ever I loved the
      other. I say it with a certain grimness. I know you, your real self, and I
      love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Know, oh, my Beloved, that in the last three months you have grown to me
      from a boy into a man, into my husband! When I think of you as you were at
      first you seem a child compared to what you are now.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXI. DEAREST LOVE:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Last night, as I went to sleep, I was thinking of you and our problem, and
      there were all sorts of uncertainties; but one thing I have to tell you,
      my Corydon&mdash;that it came to me how sweet and true, and how pure and
      good you have been; and I loved you very, very much indeed. I thought: I
      should like to tell her that, and ask her always to be so noble and
      unselfish. Can you not realize how all your deficiencies are as nothing to
      me, in the sight of that one unapproachable perfection? For my Corydon is
      all devotion and love, and pure, pure, maiden goodness! And there is quite
      a whole heart full of feeling for you in that, and I wish I had you here
      to tell you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXII. MY CORYDON:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am coming more and more to realize myself, and what is the single
      faculty I have been given. I think of a dear clergyman friend I used to
      have, and I realize what a <i>loving</i> heart is&mdash;what it is to
      delight in a human soul for its own sake, and to be kind to it, fond of
      it. And I know that there could not be a man with less of that than I
      have. Certainly I know this, I never did love a soul for its own sake, and
      don't think I could. I love beauty, and truth, and power, and I hate
      everything else, if it come across my way. If I had to live the life of
      that clergyman friend I should be insane in a month. I see this as
      something very hateful; but there is only one thing I can do, to see that
      I hate my own self more than I hate any other self&mdash;and work, work,
      for the thing I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      You asked me once to tell you if your death would make any difference to
      me. If you were to die to-morrow I should feel that a sacred opportunity
      was gone out of my life, that all my efforts must have less result forever
      after. But I do not think I should stop working a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you because you are something upon which I may exert the force of
      my will. I honestly believe that the truest word, the nearest to my
      character, I ever spoke. If I care about you it is for one thing, and one
      only&mdash;because you are a soul hungry for life, because you are capable
      of sacrifice and high effort, because you are sensitive and eager. I love
      you and honor you for this; I take you to my bosom, I give all my life to
      your service; and I shall make you a perfect woman, or else kill you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must understand what I want; I want no concrete thing, no dozen
      languages to throw you into despair. I want effort, effort, <i>effort!</i>
      That's all. And I believe that you might be a stronger soul than I at this
      moment, if only you chose to hunt yourself out and fight! That is truly
      what I feel about you, and that is why I love you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXIII. DEAREST THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have no more to say, my precious one; I bow in joy before your will,
      your certainty, your power. Let it be so, I shall adore you as I so long
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are giving me all I could ask for. What more could I wish from you,
      dear Thyrsis, than to know you will never leave my side? I will try not to
      do any more bemoaning of my shortcomings. To-night I reached a wonderful
      security and almost sublimity, until I could have fallen on my face and
      praised God for His mercy. I talked out loud to myself, I exhorted myself,
      I explained to myself what is my beauty and possibility in life&mdash;the
      <i>reason</i> for which I was born. I was quite lifted out of myself, by a
      conviction that came like a benediction, that the essence of my soul was
      good and pure, and that if anybody upon earth had the power to reach God,
      it was myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear God, <i>how</i> I have spent the years of my life! like an imbecile!
      But you&mdash;if you take me, I shall go mad&mdash;I shall love you like a
      tigress! I shall implore you to invent any way that will enable me to
      realize life! Oh, if you take me, how madly I shall love you! I fancy
      myself seeing you now, and I don't know what I should do&mdash;I love you
      so dreadfully! I think of you, and everything about you seems so
      wondrously beautiful to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost have a feeling that I have no right to love you so much. Oh, tell
      me, do you want me to love you as I can? Already you seem part of me, mine&mdash;mine!
      And it is wonderful how you help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXIV. Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the whole day in the park without a bite to eat, because I did not
      want to take the trouble to come home after it, and I only had five cents.
      I have tried, oh, tried to control myself and make myself saner. I am
      seized with occasional fits of the horrors, and of wild cravings for you,
      until I could scream. It is so unbearable, and I almost want to die. Oh,
      but I do <i>not</i> want to die! My imagination has become so fevered in
      the last few days&mdash;if I do not see you soon, I know not what will
      become of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never loved you so wildly&mdash;though I have always longed for
      you. I sometimes feel now as if my brain were utterly wrecked. I know not
      what is the matter; I gasp, when I think of you. I am convinced of heaven
      and hell almost in the same breath&mdash;experience each in rapid
      succession. One touch of your hand and one look, I think would cure me. I
      seem as if in a thunder-storm&mdash;pitchy blackness with flashes of light&mdash;and
      in the flashes I see you, my beloved!
    </p>
    <p>
      XXV. Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am atrociously weary of being able to depend upon myself not at all; but
      oh, how marvellously sweet and good you are to me! I shall never be able
      to pay you for your help!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Heaven, what a cup of bitterness I have drunk, since I last saw you!
      Dearest, you have really torn me to pieces, unwittingly. But now I am
      healed, and I may go on in your blessed sight, with my terrors gone
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I actually wonder if you have an earthly form! It will be very
      strange to see you and touch you, I sometimes wake up with a start at the
      thought of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      XXVI. Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I am, the most restless and miserable and uncomfortable and pining of
      creatures&mdash;a very Dido! Are you satisfied, now that you have made it
      almost impossible for me to put my mind on anything but you, you? I spend
      hours reading one page of my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was reading peaceably just now, and I suddenly thought how I would feel
      if I saw you coming in at the door. I started and could hardly believe
      that I will really see you&mdash;in something besides visions. When night
      comes I usually get fidgety, and can hardly realize I do not need to worry
      over phantoms. Then I go on with "Classicism and Romanticism in Music,"
      and I think of you&mdash;and read a line and think of you! You see, it
      doesn't do for me to be too intense, for I just devour myself, and that is
      all. My only idea of a vent is to knock my head against something.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it is the inevitable result of caring for someone you cannot
      see. Here I might be studying now, but what do I do? I go around seeking
      rest&mdash;and I write you a dozen times a day, and use up all the stamps
      in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh well, I dare say if you wished me to love you, you have accomplished
      your purpose most successfully. There is nothing in life but you, and to
      suddenly acquire a new self is most startling, and something hard to
      believe. Thyrsis, I simply cannot realize that I may go to you and find
      peace and security.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXVII. MY DEAREST CORYDON:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have just a few words to say. I have two weeks left in which to shake
      off my shoulders the fearful animal that has been tearing me. <i>For just
      three weeks to-day,</i> not a line written!
    </p>
    <p>
      The task seems almost beyond my powers. God, will people ever know how I
      have worked over this book!
    </p>
    <p>
      But unless you develop some new doubt, or I persist in writing letters, I
      ought to get it done now. I shall see you as soon as I have finished, and
      meantime I shall write no letters.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXVIII. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I would give a great deal to let you know how I have struggled and
      suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had almost <i>more</i> than I could bear&mdash;the more horrible
      because the more unreasonable. You must know it. If it disturbs you,
      please put the letter away until a favorable time. I account my trouble
      greatly physical&mdash;I have never been in such a nervous state. The
      murky despair that has come over me&mdash;that I have writhed and
      struggled in, as in the clutches of some fiend! It seems to me I have
      experienced every torment of each successive stage of Dante's Inferno. I
      know what is the emotion of a soul in all the bloom and hope of youth,
      condemned <i>to die</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke up in the middle of the night last night&mdash;and felt as if a
      monster sat by to throw a black cloth over me and smother me. I got up and
      shook myself, and my heart was beating violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I managed to get myself free. This morning I am better. God in Heaven only
      knows&mdash;I would rather be torn limb from limb, yes, honestly, than
      endure the blackness of soul that I have had through all these years of
      strife and failure by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest Thyrsis:
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if I have written to you a few words, I shall be able to put my
      mind on study&mdash;as so far I have not done. I actually to-night have
      been indulging in all sorts of romantic moods about you. I felt in a
      singing mood, and when I came up from dinner I put on a beautiful dress,
      just for fun, and I looked quite radiant. I dreamed of you, and imagined
      that you were at my feet, in true Romeo fashion&mdash;and I was your
      Juliet. I imagined&mdash;I couldn't help thinking of this, and I knew I
      ought to be doing something else! Oh, but how I want a poor taste of joy!
      You were my Romeo to-night&mdash;you were beautiful and young and loving;
      and well, I had one dream of youth and happiness before my miseries begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have felt that we were very near to each other lately. You have shown me
      the tenderness of your heart, and I love you quite rapturously. I love
      your goodness, your sympathy&mdash;perhaps when I see you I can tell you!
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXX. DEAREST THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I received a postal just now, saying that you were coming soon. I had my
      usual queer faintness. It was like receiving word from the dead&mdash;it
      seemed such centuries&mdash;aeons&mdash;since I heard from you! I send you
      this batch of notes I have written you at various times, a sort of mental
      itinerary, for my mind has traveled into all sorts of queer places, back
      and forth. I tell you that without your continual influence, I am lost in
      doubt and uncertainty. Please try to understand these notes and my fits of
      love and fear.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXXI. DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am in one of my cast-iron moods, this morning&mdash;in a fighting mood,
      I do not care with whom or what. You, even you, have not altogether
      understood me&mdash;you have often given me a dog's portion. I have been a
      slave, a cowering kitten before you, and you (unwittingly I know) have
      done much to destroy all my courage and hope and love&mdash;by what you
      call making me aware of your higher self. Fortunately I <i>know</i> what
      your higher self is, quite as well as you do, if not a little better&mdash;and
      I know that it is the self that most strengthens my love and courage, the
      self that most fills me with life. I have a right to life as well as you,
      and a right to the love in you that most inspires me. I feel I am capable
      of judging this, in spite of all my lack of education, and my inability to
      follow you in your intellectual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought lately that you were able to make yourself believe that you
      were anything you wished to think yourself. Whenever you wring my heart
      and deprive me of strength, I shall go somewhere alone, and when I have
      controlled myself, come back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say you are master&mdash;but it must be master of the right. I want
      strength, and why you should think it right ever to have helped to throw
      me into more despair, I do not know. The reason I have written all this is
      because such ideas have come to me lately, and a fear that sometimes you
      might resort to your unloving methods, with the thought of its being
      right. I tell you I would rather stay at home, than ever go through with
      some of the pangs you have cost me, in what you called your higher moods.
      You must not gainsay me, that I am also capable of respecting high moods
      and bowing before them; but it would seem to me that they are only high if
      they are a source of inspiration and joy to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we love each other, would that be any reason why we must dote upon
      each other, or sink from our high resolves? I cannot see why our love for
      each other should not always be a means of our reaching our higher selves.
      You need not answer this letter&mdash;but when you come back, tell me
      whether what I say impresses you as being right or wrong&mdash;if there is
      not some justification in it. But perhaps I should wait. I have no right
      to disturb you now.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXXII. THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I woke up this morning with the feeling that I did not love you. That same
      thing has happened to me two or three times, and I do not understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be because at the present moment you do not love <i>me!</i> You
      are writing your book, and telling yourself that you cannot love me as you
      ought! Is this so? It is only a surmise on my part, and I do not know, but
      I should not be surprised if you were. I only know that the one thing that
      can bring us together is love, and I do not love you now. Perhaps you can
      explain it to me. I write this absolutely without emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you there have been things horribly wrong about you. You have done
      anything but inspire love in my heart&mdash;you have never seen me with
      love in my heart. Until lately, I never have felt any love for you;
      before, I simply compelled myself to think I loved you, because my life
      seemed to depend upon it. There have been many times when, as I look back,
      you seem to me to have been base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well may you preach, while you are alone, and are monarch of yourself. I
      shall have to have more of a chance than has ever come to me, before I
      will bear your displeasure or your exhortations. If you come to me and
      speak to me of the high, proud self that I must reach, every vestige of
      love for you will leave my heart, and I would as soon marry a stone
      pillar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Great Heaven, what strange moods I have! I picture our meeting each other,
      unmoved by love; you determined, energetic, indifferent to all things,
      myself included; and I disappointed, but with a hardness in my heart&mdash;no
      tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am indulging now in the most lifeless and gloomy of broodings; if you do
      not come back to me, the only soul I can love, if you are not joyful and
      strong, sincere, sympathetic, and loving, all of these&mdash;I shall know
      it is a farce for me to ever hope to gain any life with <i>you</i>. I do
      not believe that any woman can grow without love, and a great deal of it.
      Why do you suppose I am writing all this&mdash;I, who have felt such deep
      and true love for you? I have no courage&mdash;the dampness of the day has
      settled into my soul&mdash;and I shall be joyless until there is no more
      cursed doubt of you and your love for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      XXXIII. Dear Corydon: Against resolutions, I am writing to you again. I
      thought of you&mdash;there is a boat up the lake to-day with some hunters,
      and if I finish this letter, I can send it in by them as they pass. I have
      many things to tell you, and you must think about them.

    <p>
      This is one of my paralyzing letters. It will reach you Monday. I can't
      tell where I may be then. I have been wrestling with the end of the book,
      and I am wild with rage at my impotence. The fact has come to me that no
      amount of will is enough, because all my life is cowardly and false. I
      have found myself wanting <i>to sneak through this work</i>, and come home
      and enjoy myself; and you can't sneak with God, and that's all. I cannot
      come home beaten, and so here I am, still struggling&mdash;and with snow
      on the ground, and the shack so cold that I sit half in the fire-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think of you, and at times when my soul is afire, I imagine I can do
      anything. I see that you are helpless, but I think that I can change your
      whole being, and <i>make</i> you what I wish. But then that feeling dies
      out, and I think of you as you <i>are</i>, and with despair. I do not
      allude to any of your "deficiencies"&mdash;music, learning, and other
      stuff. I mean your life-force, or your lack of it. I see that you have
      learned nothing of the unspeakable, unattainable thing for which I am
      panting. And it has come to me that I dare not marry you, that I should be
      binding my life to ruin. My head is surging with plans, and a whole
      infinity of future, and I simply cannot carry any woman with me on this
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I say this, I see the tears of despair in your eyes. I can only tell
      you what I am&mdash;God made me for an <i>artist,</i> not a <i>lover!</i>
      I have not deep feelings&mdash;I do not care for human suffering; I can <i>work,</i>
      that is all. Art is no respecter of persons, and neither am I&mdash;I
      labor for something which is not of self, and requires denial of self. And
      as I think about you, the feeling comes to me that it is not this you
      want, that I should make you utterly wretched if I married you. You love
      <i>love;</i> you do not wish to fling yourself into a struggle such as my
      life must be. I see that in all your letters&mdash;your terror of this
      highest self of mine. If you married me, you would have to fight a battle
      that would almost kill you. You would have to wear your heart out, night
      and day&mdash;you would have to lose yourself and your feelings&mdash;fling
      away everything, and live in self-contempt and effort. You would have to
      know it&mdash;I can't help it&mdash;that I love life, and that to human
      hearts I owe no allegiance; that to me they are simply impatience and
      vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you want such a life? If you can learn to love it for what it is&mdash;a
      wild, unnatural, but royal life&mdash;very well. If you are coming to me
      with pleading eyes, secretly wishing for affection, and in terror of me
      when you don't get it, then God help you, that is all!
    </p>
    <p>
      You are a child, and you can not dream what I mean. But every day I learn
      something more of a great savage force of mine, that will stand out
      against the rest of this world, that is burning me up, that is driving me
      mad. One of two things it will do to you&mdash;it will make you the same
      kind of creature, or it will tear the soul out of you. Do you understand
      that? And nothing will stop it&mdash;it cares for nothing in the world but
      the utterance of itself! And if you wish to marry me, it will be with no
      promise of mine save to wreak it upon you! To take you, and make you just
      such a creature, kill or cure&mdash;nothing else! Not one instant's
      patience&mdash;but just one insistent, frantic demand that you succeed&mdash;and
      fiery, writhing disgust with you when you do not succeed&mdash;disgust
      that will make you scream&mdash;and make you live! Do you understand this&mdash;and
      do you get any idea of the temper behind this? And how it seems to you, I
      don't know&mdash;it is the only kind of truth I am capable of; I shall
      simply fling naked the force of my passionate, raging will, and punish you
      with it each instant of your life&mdash;until you understand it, and love
      it, and worship it, as I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I don't know what you will think about this letter&mdash;and I don't
      care. It is here&mdash;and you must take it. It does not come to you for
      criticism, any more than it would come for criticism to the world. It will
      rule the world. If I marry you I must live all my soul before you, and you
      must share it; if you think you can do this without first having suffered,
      having first torn loose your own crushed self, you are mistaken. But
      remember this&mdash;I shall demand from you just as much fire as I give;
      you may say you <i>cannot</i>, you may weep and say you cannot&mdash;I
      will gnash my teeth at you and say you <i>must</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I'm a fool to think I can do this. At any rate, I don't want to do
      anything else; I am a fool to think of doing anything else, and you to let
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>cannot</i> be false to my art without having a reaction of disgust,
      and you cannot marry me, unless you understand that. When I sat down to
      this letter I called myself mad for trying to tie my life to yours. Now I
      am interested in you again. You may wish to make this cast still; and oh,
      of course I shall drop back as usual, and you'll be happy, and I'll be
      your "Romeo"!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ugh</i>&mdash;how I hated that letter! <i>"Romeo"</i> indeed! Wouldn't
      we have a fine sentimental time&mdash;you with your prettiest dress on,
      and I holding you in my arms and telling you how much I loved you!
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXXIV. MY DEAR THYRSIS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I shall be your wife. This thought takes hold of me firmly and calmly, and
      I have no tears, nor fright, nor uncertainty. I suffered, of course, while
      I read your letter, and my self-control toppled, but no "tears of despair"
      came into my eyes. I am not despairing&mdash;I shall be your wife, and I
      shall feel that for many years one of my greatest efforts will be to
      prevent you from becoming my "Romeo." I am very weak and human, and you
      become that easily&mdash;do you know it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejoice, I have gained my self-control, and well, I am going to be your
      wife. Or else (it comes to me quite as a matter of course, without any
      feeling of it being unnatural or unusual) I shall not care to live. But
      after all, I do not fear that I shall die&mdash;I shall be your wife. You
      may even gainsay it, you may <i>even</i> tell me I shall ruin your life,
      you may <i>even</i> tell me that you refuse to take me&mdash;but sooner or
      later I shall be your wife. I say it with perfect certainty, and almost
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unfortunate that at such a time as this I cannot see you&mdash;it is
      quite cruelly wicked. There is so much to say, not all in <i>your</i>
      favor either. Some day I shall learn to bring out and keep before me that
      higher self of yours, which <i>now</i> I do not fear. I also have a higher
      self, though it does not show itself very often. It is a self which can
      meet that self of yours without flinching, but which loves it, and
      stretches out its arms to it&mdash;which knows that without that self of
      yours it cannot, <i>will</i> not live. It is hard to realize such a thing,
      but I beseech you no longer, I am going with you. You see now, I have no
      fear of your not taking me&mdash;I simply have no fear of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had, I could not write you this way. But you have been the means of
      showing me I <i>can</i> awaken, and that I was not meant to live the life
      of the people around me. Chance tried hard to put me to sleep forever, but
      you have roused me. Dear me, how I smile to myself at my confidence! But I
      am so sure&mdash;this feeling would not be in my heart if it had no
      meaning! I was not meant for this life I am leading. I am not afraid
      because I have no proof that I am a genius, and no prospect of being one
      at present. I do not know whether what you have must come as an
      inspiration direct from God, I do not know whether I am <i>capable</i> of
      winning any of this life that you are seeking; but I do know this&mdash;I'm
      going to have the chance to try, and you are going to give it to me. Do
      you suppose I could tell you that I am willing to stay at home and let you
      leave me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not even any fear now of your wishing to leave me. Why, I wouldn't
      hold my life at a pennyworth if you were out of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are my only means of breathing, you fool," I thought. I sometimes
      wonder how you could think of leaving me, when I feel as I do at present.
      I ask myself why it is that you know nothing of it, and why it does not
      make you put out your hand in gladness to me&mdash;how you could write me
      that all my letters showed you I did not want to struggle to lead your
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      My words are failing me now&mdash;this is probably the reason you know
      nothing about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, when I have written you before this, I have been worrying and
      doubting and afraid. I am none of these now; and I do not believe I am
      deluding myself&mdash;in fact I <i>know</i> I am not. <i>I shall be your
      wife.</i> It is indeed a pity I cannot talk to you now&mdash;yes, a very
      great pity. It is also rather incomprehensible, that you can imagine
      leaving me <i>now.</i> And all my letters have told you that I wish to be
      petted and cuddled, did they? If you were here, I do not know that it
      would do any good to give my feelings vent, it would profit me nothing to
      strike you, and what could I do? I cannot hate you&mdash;it is not natural
      that one should hate one's husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some day, oh, <i>some</i> day, I tell myself&mdash;you will no lonnger
      play and trifle with me and my soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you really think you are going to put me to sleep again? Surely my
      life is something; and you have given me some reason for its existence. I
      can hardly tell you what I wish to say; people run in and out, and I am
      bothered&mdash;I suppose this is one of my tasks. But do you not see that
      you have taken the responsibility of a soul into your hands? I cannot live
      without you. What is it&mdash;do creatures go around the world struggling
      and saying they must live, and are they only pitiful fools for trying?
    </p>
    <p>
      And are you one of God's chosen ones? Will you tell me, "Corydon, you
      simply cannot live my life&mdash;you are not fit?" Dear Thyrsis, I
      actually believe that if you should tell me that now, I should laugh with
      joy, for I would see that I had gained one victory, that of proving to you
      your own weakness and stupidity. And I should not let you discourage me. I
      should throw my arms around your neck, and cling to you until you had
      promised to take me. After all, it is a small boon to ask the privilege of
      trying to live, it cannot but be a glory to you to help me; and if I do
      not make you waste your time or money, how can I hinder you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask yourself how you have treated me&mdash;have I not suffered a little?
      Though I may have been miserably weak, have I not now a little courage?
      Why do the moments blind you so, that you can speak to me as though I were
      a sawdust doll?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one thing that I will let myself do. I know that you are
      strong and brave, and that I can be if I go with you; and I am going with
      you&mdash;there simply is no other alternative&mdash;for I love you! Yes,
      dear, I saw it very plainly as I read your letter to-day. I seem to feel
      very differently about it all now. I know we <i>cannot</i> sit still and
      love each other&mdash;this costs me no pang. You need not love me one bit;
      I may simply belong to you, we may simply belong to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see how I fall into blindness of the high things at home. How almost
      impossible it is for me to do anything, while I have the earthly ties of
      love! I study&mdash;but how? How is it possible to live the physical life
      of other people&mdash;to be sympathetic and agreeable and conciliatory,
      and gain anything for your own soul? How is such a creature as myself to
      get what it wants, unless it goes away where there are no contrary and
      disturbing influences&mdash;where it has no ties, no obligations? The
      souls that have won, how did they do it&mdash;did they go alone, or did
      they stay in the parlor and serve tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such thoughts as these would make me grovel at your feet, if need be, in
      an agony of prayer. The means, I cry&mdash;and you are the means! What is
      there for me, then, but to beseech you to have faith in me? I suppose, as
      yet, you have little or no cause&mdash;though once or twice I have risen
      to you, even though perhaps you did not know it. I am almost happy now&mdash;for
      I feel that this <i>useless</i> strife is at an end, this craving and
      wondering if you wish to leave me. And for all that, I despise you, too&mdash;for
      your blind and wanton cruelty in wishing to crush what you have created!
      How do you expect God to value your soul, when you so lightly value mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, will it help me to beseech you? The thing I honor in you is
      your desire to be right&mdash;and I know that you will act toward me as
      your sense of right prompts you. You will act toward me as you feel you <i>must</i>
      do, to be true. Yes, be true to yourself, please; I am happy to trust in
      yourself so. If you believe that I will mar your life, I do not wish to go
      I with you. I do not know why, but I feel that something has come to me to
      prevent my despair from returning; I shall take care of my soul&mdash;there
      <i>must</i> be something for me in this life. I have a feeling that
      perhaps you will think I am writing this last mute acceptance of your
      will, without knowing what I am doing. But I <i>know</i> that I shall
      struggle without you, I shall not die.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I wish that you would do one thing&mdash;see me as soon as you can;
      let it be early in the morning, and it shall be decided <i>on</i> <i>that</i>
      <i>day</i> whether I am to marry you or not. I shall leave you, not to see
      you again&mdash;or knowing that I am to be your wife. I am sick unto death
      of fuming and sighing, tears and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will you do, Thyrsis? I cannot write any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I unfold the letter again. <i>What, in the name of God, are you going to
      do?</i>

      BOOK IV. THE VICTIM APPROACHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A silence had fallen upon them. She sat watching where the light of the
      sun flickered among the birches; and he had the book in his hand, and was
      turning the pages idly. He read&mdash; </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "I know these slopes; who knows them if not I?"
</pre>
    <p>
      And she smiled, and quoted in return&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Here cam'st thou in thy jocund youthful time,
    Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!
    And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. It was early one November afternoon, in his cabin in the forest,
      that Thyrsis wrote the last of his minstrel's songs. He had not been able
      to tell when it would come to him, so he had made no preparations; but
      when the last word was on the paper, he sprang to his feet, and strode
      through the snow-clad forest to the nearest farm-house. The farmer came
      with a wagon, and Thyrsis bundled all his belongings into his trunk, and
      took the night-train for the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came like a young god, radiant and clothed in glory. All the creatures
      of his dreams were awake within him, all his demons and his muses; he had
      but to call them and they answered. There was a sound of trumpets and
      harps in his soul all day; he was like a man half walking, half running,
      in the midst of a great storm of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fought the good fight, and he had conquered. The world was at his
      feet, and he had no longer any fear of it. The jangling of the street-cars
      was music to him, the roar and rush of the city stirred his pulses&mdash;this
      was the life he had come to shape to his will!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he came to Corydon, glorious and irresistible. His mind was quite
      made up&mdash;he would take her; he was master now, he had no longer any
      doubts or fears. He was thrilled all through him with the thought of her;
      how wonderful it was at such an hour to have some one to communicate with&mdash;some
      one in whose features he could see a reflection of his own exaltation! He
      recollected the words of the old German poet&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Der ist selig zu begrussen Der ein treues Herze weiss!"
</pre>
    <p>
      He went to Corydon's home. In the parlor he came upon her unannounced; and
      she started and stared at him as at a ghost. She did not make a sound, but
      he saw the pallor sweep over her face, he saw her tremble and sway. She
      was like a reed shaken by the wind&mdash;so fragile and so sensitive! He
      got a sudden sense of the storm of emotion that was shaking her; and it
      frightened him, while at the same time it thrilled him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came and took her hands in his, and gently touched her cheek with his
      lips. She stared at him dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, sweetheart," he whispered. "It's all right." And she
      closed her eyes, and it seemed as if to breathe was all she could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, dearest," he said. "Let us go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      And half in a daze she put on her hat and coat, and they went out on the
      street. He took her arm to steady her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, dearest," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got my letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I got it. And it was a wonderful letter. It couldn't have been
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's no more to be said. There's no refusing such a challenge. You
      shall come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis! Do you <i>want</i> me to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "I want you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he felt a tremor pass through her arm. He pressed it tightly to his
      side. "I love you!" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah Thyrsis!" she exclaimed. "How you have tortured me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, dear!" he replied. "Let's not think of that. It's all past now. We
      are going on! You have proven your grit. You are wonderful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the park, and sat upon a bench in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've finished the book!" he said. "And in a couple more days it'll be
      copied. I've a letter of introduction to a publisher, and he wrote me he'd
      read it at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems like a dream to me," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't have to wait long after that," he said. "Everything will be
      clear before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what will you do in the meantime?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother wants me to stay with her," he said. "I've only got ten dollars
      left. But I'll get some from the publisher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure you can?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Corydon!" he cried, "you've no idea how wonderful it is&mdash;the
      book, I mean. You'll be amazed! It kept growing on me all the time&mdash;I
      got new visions of it. That was why it took me so long. I didn't dare to
      appreciate it, while I was doing it&mdash;I had to keep myself at work,
      you know; but now that it's done, I can realize it. And oh, it's a book
      the world will heed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When can I see it, Thyrsis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as it's copied&mdash;the manuscript is all a scrawl. But you know
      the minstrel's song at the end? My Gethsemane, I called it! I found a new
      form for it&mdash;it's all in free verse. I didn't mean it to be that way,
      but it just wrote itself; it broke through the bars and ran away with me.
      Oh, it marches like the thunder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled some papers from his coat-pocket. "I was going over it on the
      train this morning," he said. "Listen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He read her the song, thrilling anew with the joy of its effect upon her.
      "Oh, Thyrsis!" she cried, in awe. "That is marvellous! Marvellous! How
      could you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, for all the delight she expressed, Thyrsis was conscious of a
      chill of disappointment, of a doubt lurking in the background of his mind.
      It was inevitable, in the nature of things&mdash;how could the book mean
      to any human creature what it had meant to him? Seven long months he had
      toiled with it, he had been through the agonies of a child-birth for it.
      And another person would read it all in one day!&mdash;It was the old, old
      agony of the artist, who can communicate so small a part of what has been
      in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. He wanted to talk about his book, but Corydon wanted to talk
      about him. She had waited so long, and suffered so much&mdash;and now at
      last he was here! "Oh, Thyrsis!" she cried. "There's just no use in my
      trying&mdash;I can't do anything at all without you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't have to do it any more," he said. "We shall not part again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are sure you want me? You have no more doubts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I have any doubts&mdash;after that letter. Ah, that was a brave
      letter, Corydon! It made me think of you as some old Viking's daughter!
      That is the way to go at the task!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then I may feel certain!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may stop thinking all about it," he replied. "We'll waste no more of
      our time&mdash;we'll put it aside and get to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the day wandering about in the park and talking over their
      plans. "I suppose it'll be all right now that I'm with you," said Thyrsis.
      "I mean, there's no great hurry about getting married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" she answered. "We dare not think of that, until you have money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I wish we didn't have to get married!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because-why should we have to get anybody else's permission to live our
      lives? I've thought about it a good deal, and it's a slave-custom, and it
      makes me ashamed of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you believe in marriage, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, and I don't. I believe that a man who exposes a woman to the
      possibility of having a child, ought to guarantee to support the woman for
      a time, and to support the child. That's obvious enough&mdash;no one but a
      scoundrel would want to avoid it. But marriage means so much more than
      that! You bind yourself to stay together, whether love continues or
      whether it stops; you can't part, except on some terms that other people
      set down. You have to make all sorts of promises you don't intend to keep,
      and to go through forms you don't believe in, and it seems to me a
      cowardly thing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what else can one do?" asked Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite obvious what <i>we</i> could do. We don't intend to be husband
      and wife; and so we could simply go away and go on with our work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But think of our parents, Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know&mdash;I've thought of them. But if every one thought of his
      parents, how would the world ever move?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dearest!" exclaimed Corydon, "if we didn't marry, they'd simply go
      out of their senses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. But then, they might threaten to go out of their senses if we <i>did</i>
      marry? And would that work also?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must be sensible," said the girl. "It means so much to them, and so
      little to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose so," he answered. "But all the same, I hate it; when you
      once begin conforming, you never know where you'll stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>We</i> shall know," declared the other. "Whatever we may have to do to
      get married, we shall both of us know that neither would ever dream of
      wishing to hold the other for a moment after love had ceased. And that is
      the essential thing, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," assented Thyrsis. "I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, we'll make that bargain between us; that will be <i>our</i>
      marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That suits me better," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought for a moment, and then said, with a laugh, "Let us have a
      little ceremony of our own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ready for it now?" she inquired. "Your mind is quite made up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite made up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her, to make sure that no one was in sight; and then she
      put her hand in his. "I have been to weddings," she said. "And so I know
      how they do it.&mdash;I take thee, Thyrsis, to be the companion of my
      soul. I give myself to thee freely, for the sake of love, and I will stay
      so long as thy soul is better with me than without. But if ever this
      should cease to be, I will leave thee; for if my soul is weaker than
      thine, I have no right to be thy mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. "Is that right?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "that is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well then," she said; "and now, you say it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she made him repeat the words&mdash;"I take thee, Corydon, to be the
      companion of my soul. I give myself to thee freely, for the sake of love,
      and I will stay so long as thy soul is better with me than without. But if
      ever this should cease to be, I will leave thee; for if my soul is weaker
      than thine, I have no right to be thy mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," she exclaimed, with an eager laugh&mdash;"now we're married!" And
      as he looked he caught the glint of a tear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. But the world would not be content to leave it on that basis.
      When they parted that afternoon, it was with a carefully-arranged program
      of work&mdash;they were to visit each other on alternate days and go on
      with their German and music. But in less than a week they had run upon an
      obstruction; there was no quiet room for them at Corydon's save her
      bedroom, and one evening when Thyrsis came, she made the announcement that
      they could no longer study there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," explained Corydon, "they say the maid might think it wasn't nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had expected him to fly into a rage, but he only smiled grimly. "I had
      come to tell you the same sort of thing," he explained. "It seems you
      can't visit me so often, and you're never to stay after ten o'clock at
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is that?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a question of what the hall-boy might think," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat gazing at each other in silence. "You see," said Thyrsis, at
      last, "the thing is impossible&mdash;we've got to go and get married. The
      world will never give us any peace until we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody has any idea of what we mean!" exclaimed Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No idea whatever," he said. "They've nothing in them in anyway to
      correspond with it. You talk to them about souls, and they haven't any.
      You talk to them about love, and they think you mean obscenity. Everybody
      is thinking obscenity about us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody but our parents," put in Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which he answered, angrily, "They are thinking of what the others are
      thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      But everybody seemed to have to think something, and that was the aspect
      of the matter that puzzled them most. Why did everybody find it necessary
      to be thinking about it at all? Why did everybody consider it his
      business? As Thyrsis phrased it&mdash;"Why the hell can't they let us
      alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to get married," said she. "That's the only way to get the best
      of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is that really getting the best of them?" he objected. "Isn't that
      their purpose&mdash;to make us get married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a pregnant question, but they did not follow it up just then.
      They went on to the practical problem of where and when and how to
      accomplish their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can go to a court," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" she exclaimed. "We'd have to meet a lot of men, and I couldn't
      stand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely you don't want to go to a church!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't we get some clergyman to marry us quietly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then, there's a lot of rigmarole!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mightn't he leave it out?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," he said. "They generally believe in it, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to make an attempt, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go to-morrow morning," he said. "I'm going over to have the
      sound-post set in my violin, and that'll take an hour or so. Perhaps we
      can finish it up in the meantime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good idea," said Corydon. "It'll give me to-night to tell mother and
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. So behold them, the next morning, emerging from the little shop
      of the violin-dealer, and seeking for some one to fasten them in the holy
      bonds of matrimony! They were walking down a great avenue, and there were
      many churches&mdash;but they were all rich churches. "I never thought
      about it before," said Thyrsis. "But I wonder if there are any poor
      churches in the city!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped in front of one brown-stone structure that looked a trifle
      less elaborate. "It says Presbyterian," said Corydon, reading the sign. "I
      wonder how they do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said he. "But he'd want a lot of money, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mightn't he have a curate, or something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goose," laughed Thyrsis, "there are no Presbyterian curates!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know what I mean," she said&mdash;"an assistant, or an
      apprentice, or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said he. "Let's go and ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with much trepidation, they rang the bell of the parsonage on the
      side-street. But the white-capped maid who answered told them that the
      pastor was not in, and that there were no curates or apprentices about.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you suppose they charge, anyway?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;I think you give what you can spare. How much money
      have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got eight dollars to my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got it with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;all of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get my twenty-five to-morrow," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really get it?" he asked. "You can depend on it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes&mdash;it comes the middle of each month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard of people getting incomes from investments, and things like
      that, but it always seemed hard to believe. I never thought I'd meet with
      it in my own life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's certainly very nice," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does it come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a trustee of the estate who sends it. It's Mr. Hammond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That bald-headed man I met once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's the one. He's quite a well-known lawyer, and they say I'm
      fortunate to have him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Thyrsis. "I'll have to look into it some day. You know you
      have to endow me with all your worldly goods!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on down the avenue, and came to a Jewish temple with a gilded
      dome. "I wonder how that would do," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it would do at all," said Thyrsis. "We'd surely have to
      believe something there."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went on again. And on a corner, as they stopped to look about
      them, a strange mood came suddenly to Thyrsis. It was as if a veil was
      rent before him&mdash;as if a bolt of lightning had flashed. What was he
      going to do? He was going to bind himself in marriage! He was going to be
      trapped&mdash;he, the wild thing, the young stag of the forest!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked Corydon, seeing him standing motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I was just thinking," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was afraid, Corydon, I wondered if we were sure&mdash;if we realized&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we <i>realized!</i>" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know&mdash;it'll be forever&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Thyrsis!" she exclaimed, in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he started, and laughed uneasily. "It was just a queer fancy that
      came to me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how <i>could</i> you!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, dearest," he said, hurriedly&mdash;"it's nothing. It seems so
      strange, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the block they came to another church. "Unitarian!" he
      exclaimed. "Oh, maybe that's just the thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they went in, and found a friendly clergyman, Dr. Hamilton by name,
      to whom they explained their plight. They answered his questions&mdash;yes,
      they were both of age, and they had told their parents. Also, with much
      stammering, Thyrsis explained that his worldly goods amounted to eight
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;how are you going to live?" asked Dr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was tempted to mention the masterpiece, but he decided not to.
      "I'm going to earn money," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," responded the other, "I suppose it's all right. I'll marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the sexton was called in for a witness, and the clergyman stood
      before them and made a little speech, and said a prayer, and then joined
      their hands together and pronounced the spell. The two trembled just a
      little, but answered bravely, "I do," in the proper places, and then it
      was over. They shook hands with the doctor, and promised to come hear one
      of his sermons; and with much trepidation they paid him two dollars, which
      he in turn paid to the sexton. And then they went outside, and drew a
      great breath of relief. "It wasn't half as bad as I expected," the
      bridegroom confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. Thyris invested in a newspaper, and as they went back to get the
      violin they read the advertisements of furnished rooms. In respectable
      neighborhoods which they tried they found that the prices were impossible
      for them; but at last, upon the edge of a tenement district, they found a
      corner flat-house, with a saloon underneath, where there were two tiny
      bedrooms for rent in an apartment. The woman, who was a seamstress, was
      away a good deal in the day, and Corydon learned with delight that she
      might use the piano in the parlor. The rooms were the smallest they had
      ever seen, but they were clean, and the price was only fifty cents a day&mdash;a
      dollar and a half a week for Thyrsis' and two dollars for Corydon's,
      because there was a steam-radiator in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a racket of school-children and of streetcars from the avenue
      below, but they judged they would get used to this; and having duly
      satisfied the landlady that they were married, and having ascertained that
      she had no objection to "light housekeeping," they engaged the rooms and
      paid a week's rent in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That leaves us two and a half to start life on!" said Thyrsis, when they
      were on the street again. "Our housekeeping will be light indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, and sat down in the park to talk it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not nearly so reckless as it would seem," he argued. "For I have to
      earn money for myself any-how. And then there's the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will you hear about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called the man up the day before yesterday. He said they were reading
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you said anything to him about money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will they pay something in advance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will, I guess, if they like the story. I don't know very much about
      the business end of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We mustn't let them take advantage of us!" exclaimed Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, of course not. But I hate to have to think about the money side of
      it. It's a cruel thing that I have to sell my inspiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else could you do?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's something I've thought a great deal about," said he. "It kept
      forcing itself upon me all the time I was writing. Here I am with my
      vision&mdash;working day and night to make something beautiful and sacred,
      something without taint of self. And I have to take it to business-men,
      who will go out into the market-place and sell it to make money! It will
      come into competition with thousands of other books&mdash;and the
      publishers shouting their virtues like so many barkers at a fair. I can
      hardly bear to think of it; I'd truly rather live in a garret all my days
      than see it happen. I don't want the treasures of my soul to be hawked on
      the streets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how else could people get them?" asked Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would like to have a publishing-house of my own, and to print my books
      with good paper and strong bindings that would last, and then sell them
      for just what they cost. So the whole thing would be consistent, and I
      could tell the exact truth about what I wrote. For I know the truth about
      my work; I've no vanities, I'd be as remorseless a critic of myself as
      Shelley was. I'd be willing to leave it to time for my real friends to
      find me out&mdash;I'd give up the department-store public to the authors
      who wanted it. And then, too, I could sell my books cheaply, so that the
      poor could get them. I always shudder to think that the people who most
      need what I write will have it kept away from them, because I am holding
      it back to make a profit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must do that some day!" declared Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must live very simply," he said, "so we can begin it soon. Perhaps we
      can do it with the money we get from this first book. We could get
      everything we need for a thousand dollars a year, and save the balance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other assented to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got the prospectus of my publishing-house all written," Thyrsis went
      on. "And I've several other plans worked out&mdash;people would laugh if
      they saw them, I guess. But before I get through, I'm going to have a
      reading-room where anyone can come and get my books. It'll be down where
      the poor people are; and I'm going to have travelling libraries, so as to
      reach people in the country. That is the one hope for better things, as I
      see it&mdash;we must get ideas to the people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus discoursing, they strolled back to the home of Thyrsis' mother, and
      he went in to get his belongings together. Corydon went with him; and as
      they entered, the mother said, "There's an express package for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went to his room, and saw a flat package lying on the bed. He
      stared at it, startled, and then picked it up and read the label upon it.
      "Why&mdash;why!&mdash;" he gasped; and then he seized a pair of scissors
      and cut the string and opened it. It was his manuscript!
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers he turned it over. There was a letter with it, and
      he snatched it up. "We regret," it read, "that we cannot make you an offer
      for the publication of your book. Thanking you for the privilege of
      examining it, we are very truly yours." And that was all!
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've rejected the book!" gasped Thyrsis; and the two stared at each
      other with consternation and horror in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a possibility that had never occurred to Thyrsis in his wildest
      moment. That anyone in his senses could reject that book! That anyone
      could read a single chapter of it and not see what it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      "They only had it five days!" he exclaimed; and instantly an explanation
      flashed across his mind. "I don't believe they read it!" he cried. "I
      don't believe they ever looked at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, read or unread, there was the manuscript&mdash;rejected. There was no
      appeal from the decision; there was no explanation, no apology&mdash;they
      had simply rejected it! It was like a blow in the face to Thyrsis; he felt
      like a woman whose love is spurned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh the fools! The miserable fools!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not bring much comfort to his soul by that method. The
      seriousness of it remained. The publishing-house was one of the largest
      and most prosperous in the country; and if they were fools, how many more
      fools might there not be among those who stood between him and the public?
      And if so, what would he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. So these two began their life under the shadow of a cloud. At the
      very first hour, when they should have been all rapture, there had come
      into the chamber of their hearts this grisly spectre&mdash;that was to
      haunt them for so many years!
    </p>
    <p>
      But they clenched their hands grimly, and put the thought aside, and moved
      their worldly goods to the two tiny rooms. When they had got their trunks
      in, there was no place to sit save on the beds; and though Corydon had
      cast away all superfluities for this pilgrimage, still it was a puzzle to
      know where to put things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of that&mdash;they were together at last! What an ecstasy it was
      to be actually unpacking, and to be mingling their effects! A kind of
      symbol it was of their spiritual union, so that the most commonplace
      things became touched with meaning. Thyrsis thrilled when the other
      brought in an armful of books to him&mdash;all this wealth was to be added
      to his store! He owned no books himself, save a few text-books, and some
      volumes of poetry that he knew by heart. Other books he had borrowed all
      his life from libraries; and he often thought with wonder that there were
      people who would pay a dollar or two for a book which they did not mean to
      read but once!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also there were a hundred trifles which came from Corydon's trunk, and
      which whispered of the intimacies of her life; the pictures she put upon
      her bureau, the sachet-bags that went into the drawer, the clothing she
      hung behind the door. It disturbed him strangely to realize how close she
      was to be to him from now on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, the excursion to the corner-grocery, and the delight of the
      plunge into housekeeping! A pound of butter, and some salt and pepper, and
      a bunch of celery; a box of "chipped beef", and a dozen eggs, and a quart
      of potatoes; and then to the baker's, for rolls and sponge-cakes&mdash;did
      ever a grocer and a baker sell such ecstasies before? They carried it all
      home, and while Corydon scrubbed the celery in the bath-room, Thyrsis got
      out his chafing-dish and set the beef and eggs to sizzling, and they sat
      and sniffed the delicious odors, and meantime munched at rolls and butter,
      because they were so hungry they could not wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an Elysian festivity they made of it! And then to think that they
      would have three such picnics every day! To be sure, the purchases had
      taken one half of Thyrsis' remaining capital; but then, was it not just
      that spice of danger that gave the keen edge to their delight? What was it
      that made the sense of snugness and intimacy in their little retreat, save
      the knowledge of a cold and hostile world outside?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Thyrsis took his manuscript to another publisher, and
      then they went at their work. Corydon laughed aloud with delight as they
      began the German&mdash;for what were all its terrors now, when she had
      Thyrsis for a dictionary! They fairly romped through the books. In the
      weeks that followed they read "Werther" and "Wilhelm Meister" and
      "Wahlverwandschaften"; they read "Undine" and "Peter Schlemil" and the
      "Leben eines Taugenichts"; they read Heine's poems, and Auerbach's and
      Freitag's novels, and Wieland's "Oberon"&mdash;is there anybody in Germany
      who still reads Wieland's "Oberon?" Surely there must somewhere be young
      couples who delight in "Der Trompeter von Sekkingen," and laugh with
      delight over "der Kater Hidigeigei!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Also they went at music. Corydon had been taught to play as many "pieces"
      as the average American young lady; but Thyrsis had tried to persuade her
      to a new and desperate emprise&mdash;he insisted that there was nothing to
      music until one had learned to read it at sight. So now, every day when
      their landlady had gone out, he moved his music-stand into the little
      parlor, and they went at the task. Thyrsis proposed to achieve it by a <i>tour</i>
      <i>de</i> <i>force</i>&mdash;the way to read German was to read it, and
      the way to read music was to read music. He would set up a piece they had
      never seen before, and they would begin; and he would pound out the time
      with his foot, and make Corydon keep up with him&mdash;even though she was
      only able to get one or two notes in each bar, still she must keep up with
      him. At first this was agony to her&mdash;she wanted to linger and get
      some semblance of the music; but Thyrsis would scold and exhort and shout,
      and pound out the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, to Corydon's own amazement, it was not many weeks before she found
      that she was actually reading music, that they were playing it together.
      In this way they learned Haydn's and Mozart's sonatas, they even
      adventured Beethoven's trios, with the second violin left out. Then
      Thyrsis subscribed to a music-library, and would come home twice a week
      with an armful of new stuff, good and bad. And whenever in all their
      struggles with it they were able to achieve anything that really moved
      them as music, what a rapture it brought them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. This was indeed the nearest they could ever come to creative
      achievement together; this was the one field in which their abilities were
      equal. In all other things there were disharmonies&mdash;they came upon
      many reefs and shoals in these uncharted matrimonial seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was swift and impatient, and had flung away all care about
      external things; and here was Corydon, a woman, with all a woman's
      handicaps and disabilities. She was like a little field-mouse in her care
      of her person&mdash;she must needs scrub herself minutely every morning,
      and have hot water for her face every night; her hair had to be braided
      and her nails had to be cared for&mdash;and oh, the time it took her to
      get her clothes on, or even to get ready for the street! She would
      struggle like one possessed to accomplish it more quickly, while Thyrsis
      chafed and growled and agonized in the next room. There was nothing he
      could do meantime&mdash;for were they not going to do everything together?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was another stumbling-block&mdash;the newspapers! Thyrsis had
      to know what was going on in the world. He had learned to read the papers
      and magazines like an exchange-editor; his eye would fly from column to
      column, and he would rip the insides out of one in two or three minutes.
      To Corydon it was agony to see him do this, for it took her half an hour
      to read a newspaper. She besought him to read it out loud&mdash;and was
      powerless to understand the distress that this caused him. He stood it as
      long as he could, and then he took to marking in the papers the things
      that she needed to know; and this he continued to do religiously, until he
      had come to realize that Corydon never remembered anything that she read
      in the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was something it took him years to comprehend; there were certain
      portions of the ordinary human brain which simply did not exist in his
      wife. She had lived eighteen years in the world, and it had never occurred
      to her to ask how steam made an engine go, or what was the use of the
      little glass knobs on the telegraph-poles. And it was the same with
      politics and business, and with the thousand and one personalities of the
      hour. When these things came up, Thyrsis would patiently explain to her
      what she needed to know; and he would take it for granted that she would
      pounce upon the information and stow it away in her mind&mdash;just as he
      would have done in a similar case. But then, two or three weeks later, the
      same topic would come up, and he would see a look of sudden terror come
      into Corydon's eyes&mdash;she had forgotten every word of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, after a long time, to honor this ignorance. People had to bring
      some real credentials with them to win a place in Corydon's thoughts; it
      was not enough that they were conspicuous in the papers. And it was the
      same with facts of all sorts; science existed for Corydon only as it
      pointed to beauty, and history existed only as it was inspiring. They read
      Green's "History of the English People" in the evenings; and every now and
      then Corydon would have to go and plunge her face into cold water to keep
      her eyes open, The long parliamentary struggle was utter confusion to her&mdash;she
      had no joy to watch how "freedom slowly broadens down from precedent to
      precedent." But once in a while there would come some story, like that Of
      Joan of Arc&mdash;and there would be the girl, with her hands clenched,
      and hot tears in her eyes, and the fires of martyrdom blazing in her soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the hours which revealed to Thyrsis the treasure he had won&mdash;the
      creature of pure beauty whose heart was in his keeping. He was humbled and
      afraid before her; but the agony of it was that he could not dwell in
      those regions of joy with her&mdash;he had to know about stupid things and
      vulgar people, he had to go out among them to scramble for a living. So
      there had to be a side to his mind that Corydon could not share. And it
      did not suffice just to tolerate the existence of such things&mdash;he had
      to be actively interested in them, and to take their point of view. How
      else could he hold his place in the world, how could he win in the
      struggle for life?
    </p>
    <p>
      This, he strove to persuade himself, was the one real difficulty between
      them, the one thing that marred the perfection of their bliss. But as time
      went on, he came to suspect that there was something else&mdash;something
      even more vital and important. It seemed to him that he had given up that
      which was the chief source of his power&mdash;his isolation. The center of
      his consciousness had been shifted outside of himself; and try as he
      would, he could never get it back. Where now were the hours and hours of
      silent brooding? Where were the long battles in his own soul? And what was
      to take he place of them&mdash;could conversation do it, conversation no
      matter how interesting and worth while? Thyrsis had often quoted a saying
      of Emerson's, that "people descend to meet." And when one was married did
      not one have to descend all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      He reasoned the matter out to himself. It was not Corydon's fault, he saw
      clearly; it would have been the same had he married one of the seraphim.
      He did not want to live the life of any seraph&mdash;he wanted to live his
      own life. And was it not obvious that the mere physical proximity of
      another person kept one's attention upon external things? Was not one
      inevitably kept aware of trivialities and accidents? Thyrsis had an ideal,
      that he should never permit an idle word to pass his lips; and now he saw
      how inevitably the common-place crept in upon them&mdash;how, for
      instance, their conversation had a way of turning to personality and
      jesting. Corydon was sensitive to external things, and she kept him aware
      of the fact that his trousers were frayed and his hair unkempt, and that
      other people were remarking these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was marriage; and it made all the more difference to an author, he
      reasoned, because an author was always at home. Thyrsis had been
      accustomed, when he opened his eyes in the morning, to lie still and let
      images and fancies come trooping through his mind; he would plan his whole
      day's work in that way, while his fancy was fresh and there was nothing to
      disturb him. But now he had to get up and dress, thus scattering these
      visions. In the same way, he had been wont to walk and meditate for hours;
      but now he never walked alone. That meant incidentally that he no longer
      got the exercise he needed&mdash;because Corydon could never walk at his
      pace. And if this was the case with such external things, how much more
      was it the case with the strange impulses of his inmost soul! Thyrsis was
      now like a hunter, who starts a deer, and instead of putting spurs to his
      horse and following it, has to wait to summon a companion&mdash;and
      meanwhile, of course, the deer is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      From all this there was but one deliverance for them, and that was music.
      Music was their real interest, music was their religion; and if only they
      could go on and grow in it&mdash;if only they could acquire technique
      enough to live their lives in it! This would take years, of course; but
      they did not mind that, they were willing to work every day until they
      were exhausted&mdash;if only the world would give them a chance! But alas,
      the world did not seem to be minded that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Thyrsis had waited a week, and then written the second publisher,
      and received a reply to the effect that at least two weeks were needed for
      the consideration of a manuscript. And meantime his last penny was gone,
      and he was living on Corydon's money. It was clear that he must earn
      something at once; and so he had to leave her to study and practice in her
      own room, while he cudgelled his brains and tormented his soul with
      hack-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried his verses again; but he found that the spring had dried up in
      him. Life was now too sombre a thing, the happy spontaneous jingles came
      no more. And what he did by main force of will sounded hollow and vapid to
      him&mdash;and must have sounded so to the editors, who sent them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried book-reviewing; but oh, the ghastly farce of book-reviewing!
      To read futile writing and sham writing of a hundred degrading varieties&mdash;and
      never dare to utter a truth about them! To labor instead to put one's self
      in the place of the school-girl reader and the tired shop-clerk reader and
      the sentimental married-woman reader, and imagine what they would think
      about the book, and what they would like to have said about it! To take
      these little pieces of dishonesty to an office, and sit by trembling while
      they were read, and receive two dollars apiece for them if they were
      published, and nothing at all if one had been so lacking in cunning as to
      let the editor think that the book was not worth the space!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Thyrsis had cunning enough to earn the cost of his room and his
      food for two weeks more. Then one day the postman brought him a letter,
      the inscription of which made his heart give a throb. He ripped the
      envelope open and read a communication from the second publisher:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been interested in your manuscript, and while we do not feel that
      we can undertake its publication, we should like an opportunity to talk
      with you about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does <i>that</i> mean?" asked Corydon, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows," he answered. "I'll go and see them this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back, it was to sink into a chair and stare in front of him
      with a savage frown. "Don't ask me!" he said, to Corydon. "Don't ask!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please tell me!" cried the girl. "Did you see them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis&mdash;"I saw a fat man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fat man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a fat man. A fat body, and a fat mind, and a fat soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please tell me, Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said my book wouldn't sell, because the public had got tired of that
      sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sort of thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems that people used to buy 'historical romances', and now they've
      stopped. The man actually thought my book was one of that kind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. But then&mdash;couldn't you tell him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him. I said, 'Can't you see that this book is original&mdash;that
      it's come out of a man's heart?' 'Yes,' he said, 'perhaps. But you can't
      expect the public to see it.' And so there you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sat with his nails dug into his palms. "It's just like the
      book-reviews!" he cried. "He knows better, but that doesn't count&mdash;he's
      thinking about the public! And he's got to the point where he doesn't
      really care&mdash;he's a fat man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so he'll not publish the book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll not have anything more to do with me. He hates me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Hates</i> you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Because I have faith, and he hasn't! Because I wouldn't stoop to the
      indignity he offered!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he offer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says that what the public's reading now is society novels&mdash;stories
      about up-to-date people who are handsome and successful and rich. They
      want automobiles and theatre-parties and country-clubs in their novels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis! You don't know anything about such things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. But he said I could find out. And so I could. The point he made
      was that I've got passion and color&mdash;I could write a moving
      love-story! In other words, I could use my ecstasy to describe two
      society-people mating!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "And what did you do with the manuscript?" asked
      Corydon, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took it to another publisher," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you going to do now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been to see the editor of the 'Treasure Chest.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Treasure Chest" was a popular magazine of fiction, a copy of which
      Thyrsis had seen lying upon the table of their landlady. He had glanced
      through the first story, and had declared to Corydon that if he had a
      stenographer he could talk such a story at the rate of twenty thousand
      words a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did the editor see you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He's a big husky 'advertising man'&mdash;he looks like a
      prize-fighter. He said if I could write, to go ahead and prove it. He pays
      a cent for five words&mdash;a hundred dollars for a complete serial. He
      pays on acceptance; and he said he'd read a scenario for me. So I'm going
      to try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it to be about?" asked Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to try what they call a 'Zenda' story," said Thyrsis. "The
      editor says the readers of the 'Treasure Chest' haven't got tired of
      'Zenda' stories."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Thyrsis spent the afternoon and evening wandering about in the
      park; and sometime after midnight he wrote out his scenario. The advantage
      of a "Zenda" story was that, as the adventures happened in an imaginary
      kingdom, there would be no need to study up "local color". As for the
      conventional artificial dialect, he could get it from any of the
      "romances" in the nearby circulating library. He did not dare to take the
      scenario the next day, but waited a decent interval; and when he returned
      it was to report that the story was considered to be promising, and that
      he was to write twenty thousand words for a test.

    <p>
      Section 9. So Thyrsis shut himself up and went to work. Sometimes he wrote
      with rage seething in his heart, and sometimes with laughter on his lips.
      This latter was the case when he did the love-scenes&mdash;because of the
      "passion and color" he bestowed upon the fascinating countess and the
      clever young American engineer. He could have written the twenty thousand
      words in three days; but he waited ten days, so that the editor might not
      think that he was careless. And three days later he went back for the
      verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor said it was good, and that if the rest was like it he would
      accept the story. So Thyrsis went to work again, and finished the
      manuscript, and put it away until time enough had elapsed. And meanwhile
      came a letter from the literary head of the third publishing-house,
      regretting that he could not accept the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a friendly letter that Thyrsis went to call there, and met a
      pleasant and rather fine-souled gentleman, Mr. Ardsley by name, who told
      him a little about the problems he faced in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a fine talent," he said&mdash;"you may even have genius. Your
      book is obviously sincere&mdash;it's <i>vêcu,</i> as the French say. I
      suspect you must have been in love when you wrote it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way," said Thyrsis, flushing slightly. He had not intended that to
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. "It's overwrought in places," he went on, "and it tends
      to incoherency. But the main trouble is that it's entirely over the heads
      of the public. They don't know anything about the kind of love you're
      interested in, and they'd laugh at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then, what am I to do?" cried Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll simply have to keep on trying, till you happen to strike it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;how am I to live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Mr. Ardsley, "that is the problem." He smiled, rather sadly, as
      he sat watching the lad. "You see how <i>I've</i> solved it," he went on.
      "I was young once myself, and I tried to write novels. And in those days I
      blamed the publishers&mdash;I thought they stood in my way. But now, I see
      how it is; a publisher is engaged in a highly competitive business, and he
      barely makes interest on his capital; he can't afford to publish books
      that won't pay their way. Here am I, for instance&mdash;it's my business
      to advise this house; and if I advise them wrongly, what becomes of me? If
      I take them your manuscript and say, 'It's a real piece of work,' they'll
      ask me, 'Will it pay its way?' And I have to answer them, 'I don't think
      it will.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But such things as they publish!" exclaimed the boy, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Ardsley smiled again. "Yes," he said. "But they pay their way. In
      fact, they save the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went out. He saw quite clearly now the simple truth&mdash;it
      was not a matter of art at all, but a matter of business. It was a
      business-world, and not an art-world; and he&mdash;poor fool&mdash;was
      trying to be an artist!
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days more he toiled at his pot-boiler; and then, late at night,
      he went out to get some fresh air, and to try to shake off the load of
      despair that was upon him. And so came the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was because the wind was blowing, and Thyrsis loved the wind;
      it was a mirror of his own soul to him, incessant and irresistible and
      mysterious. And so his demons awoke again. He had gone through all that
      labor, he had built up all that glory in his spirit&mdash;and it was all
      for naught! He had made himself a flame of desire&mdash;and now it was to
      be smothered and stifled!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had written his book, and it was a great book, and they knew it. But
      all they told him was to go and write another book&mdash;and to do
      pot-boilers in the meantime! But that was impossible, he could not do it.
      He would win with the book he had written! He would make them hear him&mdash;he
      would make them read that book!
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to compose a manifesto to the world; and towards morning he came
      home and shut himself in and wrote it. He called it "Business and Art;"
      and in it he told about his book, and how he had worked over it. He told,
      quite frankly, what the book was; and he asked if there was anywhere in
      the United States a publisher who published books because they were noble,
      and not because they sold; or if there was a critic, or booklover, or
      philanthropist, or a person of any sort, who would stand by a true artist.
      "This artist will work all day and nearly all night," he wrote, "and he
      wants less than the wages of a day-laborer. All else that ever comes to
      him in his life he will give for a chance to follow his career!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Corydon awoke, and he read it to her. She listened, thrilling with
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Thyrsis!" she cried. "What are you going to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to have it printed," he said, "and send it to all the
      publishers; and also to literary men and to magazines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you going to sign your name to it?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've already signed my name to it," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when are you going to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as the book comes back from the next publisher."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down to breakfast; and afterwards, without resting, he
      finished the pot-boiler, and took it to the editor. After a due interval
      he went again, trembling and faint with anxiety. He had sold only one
      book-review, and he was using Corydon's money again. People who hated him
      had predicted that he would do just that, and he had answered that he
      would die first!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came home, radiant with delight. "He says he'll take it!" he
      proclaimed. "Only I've got to do a new ending for the fourth installment&mdash;he
      wants something more exciting. So I'm going to have the countess caught in
      a burning tower!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he wrote that, and went yet again, and came home with a hundred
      dollars buttoned tightly in his inside vest-pocket. He was like a man who
      has escaped from a dungeon. The field was clear before him at last! His
      manifesto was going out to the world!

      BOOK V. THE BAIT IS SEIZED
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>They sat, gazing down the slope of the little vale. She was turning
      idly the pages of the book, and she read to him&mdash; </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!&mdash;
      Only, methinks, some loss of habit's power
        Befalls me wandering through this upland dim.
      Once pass'd I blindfold here, at any hour;
        Now seldom come I, since I came with him."
</pre>
    <p>
      "It was here we first read the poem," he said. "Every spot brings back
      some line of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even the old oak-tree where we used to sit," she smiled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1. Thyrsis was half hoping that the next publisher would decline the
      manuscript; and he was only mildly stirred when he got a letter saying
      that although the publisher could not make an offer for the book, one of
      his readers was so much interested in it that he would like to have a talk
      with the author. Thyrsis replied that he was willing; and to his surprise
      he learned that the reader was none other than that Prof. Osborne, who in
      the university had impressed upon him his ignorance of the art of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid a call at the professor's home, and they had a long talk. There
      was nothing said about their former interview. Evidently the other
      recognized that Thyrsis had succeeded in making good his claim to be
      allowed to hew his own way; and Thyrsis was content with that tacit
      surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about the book. The professor first assured him that it would
      not sell, and then went on to explain to him why; and so they came to a
      grapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is sincere, perhaps even exalted," said Prof. Osborne; "but
      it's overstrained and exaggerated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it alive?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other pondered; he always spoke deliberately, choosing his words with
      precision. "Some people might think so," he said. "For myself, I have
      never known any such life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's that got to do with it?" cried Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has much to do with it&mdash;for me. One has to judge by what one
      knows&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can't one be taught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor meditated again. "I have lived forty-five years," he said,
      "and you have lived less than half that. I imagine that I have read more,
      studied more, thought more than you. Yet you ask me to submit myself to
      your teaching!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" cried Thyrsis, eagerly. "It is not as if it were a matter of
      learning&mdash;of scholarship&mdash;of knowledge of the world. There is an
      intensity of experience that is not dependent upon time; in the things of
      the imagination&mdash;in matters of inspiration&mdash;surely one does not
      have to be old or learned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That might be true," admitted the other, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read the poetry of Keats or Shelley, for instance. They were as young
      as I am when they wrote it, and yet you do not refuse to acknowledge its
      worth. Is it just because they are dead, and their poems are classics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So these two wrestled it out. Thyrsis could bring the other to the point
      of acknowledging that there might be genius in his work, but he could not
      bring him to the point of <i>doing</i> anything about it. The poet went
      away, seeing the situation quite clearly. Prof. Osborne was an instructor;
      it was his business to know; and if he should abdicate before one of his
      pupils, then what would become of authority? He had certain models, which
      he set before his class; these models constituted literature. If anyone
      might disregard them and proceed to create new models according to his own
      lawless impulse&mdash;then what anarchy would reign in a classroom! Under
      such circumstances, it was remarkable that the professor had even been
      willing to admit of doubts; as Thyrsis walked home he clenched his hands
      and whispered to himself, "I'll get that man some day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. The road now lay clear before Thyrsis, and accordingly he set
      grimly to work. He had his document printed upon a long slip of paper, and
      got several packages for Corydon to address. And one evening they took
      them out and dropped them into the mailbox. "And now we'll see!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon saw. When he came in for lunch the next day, Corydon came to the
      door, in great excitement. "S-sh!" she whispered. "There's a reporter
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A reporter!" he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does she want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wants an interview about the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's from the 'Morning Howl'. She's read the circular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I never sent it there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know; but she says a friend gave it to her. She knows all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went in, like a lamb to the slaughter. He was new to
      interviews, and he yielded to the graces of the friendly and sympathetic
      lady. Yes, he would be glad to tell about his book; and about where and
      how he had written it, and all the hopes he had based upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your wife tells me you've just been married!" said the lady, with a
      winning smile, and she proceeded to question him about this. They had
      become good friends by that time, and Thyrsis told her many things that he
      would not have told save to a charming lady. And then she asked for his
      picture, explaining that she could give so much more space to the "story"
      if she had one. And then she begged for a picture of Corydon, and was
      deeply hurt that she could not have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She prolonged the interview for an hour or so, and came back again and
      again in the effort to get this picture of Corydon. Finally she rose to
      go; but out in the hall, as she was bidding them good-bye, she suddenly
      exclaimed that she had left her gloves, and went back and got them, and
      then hurried away. And it was not until an hour or two later that Thyrsis
      made the horrible discovery that the photograph of Corydon which had stood
      upon his bureau was standing upon his bureau no longer!
    </p>
    <p>
      So next morning, there were their two photographs upon the second page of
      the 'Morning Howl', and a two-column headline:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "YOUTHFUL GENIUS OFFERS HIMSELF FOR SALE!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Thyrsis rushed through this article, writhing with horror and dismay. The
      woman had made him into what they called a "human interest" feature. There
      was very little about his book, but there was much about the picturesque
      circumstances under which he had written it. There was a description of
      their personal appearance&mdash;of Corydon's sweet face and soulful black
      eyes, and of his broad forehead and sensitive lips. There was also a
      complete description of their domestic <i>ménage</i>, including the
      chafing-dish and the odor of lamb-chops. There was a highly diverting
      account of how they had "eloped" with only eight dollars in the world;
      together with all the agonies of their parents, as imagined by the
      sympathetic lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been butchered to make a holiday for the readers of a yellow
      journal! "This is a wonderfully interesting world," the paper seemed to
      say&mdash;"well worth the penny it costs to read about it! Here on the
      first page is Antonio Petronelli, who cut up his sweetheart with a
      butcher-knife, and packed her in a trunk. And here are seven people burned
      in a tenement-house; and an interview with Shrike, the plunger, who made
      three millions out of the wheat-corner. But most diverting of all are
      these two little cherubs who ran away and got married, and now want the
      world to support them while they write masterpieces of literature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And could not one see the great public devouring the tale&mdash;the Wall
      Street clerks in the cars, and the shop-girls over their sandwiches and
      coffee, and the loungers in the cafes of the Tenderloin! Could not one
      picture their smiles&mdash;not contemptuous, but genial, as of people who
      have learned that it is indeed an interesting world, and well worth the
      penny it costs to read about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Corydon shed tears of rage over this humiliation, and she wrote a
      letter full of bitter scorn to the newspaper woman. In reply to it came a
      friendly note to the effect that she had done the best thing in the world
      for them&mdash;that when they knew more about life and the literary game,
      they would recognize this!
    </p>
    <p>
      The tangible results of the adventure were three. First there came a
      letter, written on scented note-paper, from a lady who commended their
      noble ideals and wished them success&mdash;but who did not sign her name.
      Second, there came a visit from a brother poet&mdash;a man about forty
      years of age, shabby and pitiful, with watery, light blue eyes and a
      feeble straggly moustache, and a manner of agonized diffidence. He stood
      in the doorway and shifted from one foot to the other, and explained that
      he had read the article, and had come because he, too, was an unrecognized
      genius. He had written two volumes of poetry, which were the greatest
      poetry ever produced in English&mdash;Milton and Shakespeare would be
      forgotten when the world had read these volumes. For ten years he had been
      trying to find some publisher or literary man to recognize him; and
      perhaps Thyrsis would be the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in and sat on the bed and unwrapped his two volumes&mdash;several
      hundred typewritten pages, elaborately bound up in covers of faded pink
      silk. And Thyrsis read one and Corydon the other, while the poet sat by
      and watched them and twisted his hands nervously. His poetry was all about
      stars and blue-bells and moonlight, about springtime and sighing lovers,
      about cold, rain-beaten graves and faded leaves of autumn&mdash;the
      subjects and the images which have been the stock in trade of minor poets
      for two thousand years and more. Thyrsis, as he read, could have marked
      fifty phrases which were feeble imitations of things in Tennyson and
      Longfellow and Keats; and he read for half an hour, in the vain hope of
      finding a single vigorous line.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interview was a very painful one. He could not bear to hurt the poor
      creature's feelings, and he did not know how to get rid of him. The matter
      was made still more difficult by the presence of Corydon, who did not know
      the models, and therefore thought the poetry was good. She let the visitor
      go on to pour out his heart; until at last came a climax that Thyrsis had
      been expecting all along. The man explained that he was a bookkeeper, out
      of work, and with a wife and three children on the verge of starvation;
      and then he tried to borrow some money from them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The third result was the important one. It was a letter from a
      publishing-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are on the lookout for vital and worth-while books," it read, "and we
      are not afraid to venture. We have been much interested in the account of
      your work, and we should be very glad if you would give us a chance to
      read it immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had never heard of this publishing-house, but that did not chill
      his delight. He hurried downtown with the manuscript, and came back to
      report. The concern was lodged in two small rooms in an obscure
      office-building. The manager, a Mr. Taylor, was a man not particularly
      prepossessing in appearance, but he was a person of intelligence, and was
      evidently interested in the book. Moreover he had promised to read it at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that same week came the reply&mdash;a reply which set the two almost
      beside themselves with happiness. "I have read your manuscript," wrote Mr.
      Taylor. "And I have no hesitation in pronouncing it a work of genius. In
      fact, I am not sure but what it is the greatest piece of literature it has
      ever been my fortune as a publisher to come upon. It is vital, and
      passionately sincere, and I will stake my reputation upon the prophecy
      that it will be an instantaneous success. I hope that we may become the
      publishers of it, and will be glad if you will come to see me at once and
      talk over terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read this aloud; and then he caught Corydon in his arms, and tears
      of joy and relief ran down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to see the publisher, and for ten or fifteen nunutes he listened
      to such a panegyric upon his book as made his cheeks burn. Visions of
      freedom and triumph rose before him&mdash;he had come into his own at
      last. An then Mr. Taylor proceeded to outline his business proposition&mdash;and
      as Thyrsis realized the nature of it, it was as if he had been suddenly
      plunged into an Arctic sea. The man wanted him to pay one-half the cost of
      the plates of his book, and in addition to guarantee to take one hundred
      copies at the wholesale price of ninety cents per copy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that&mdash;is that customary in publishing?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always," Mr. Taylor replied; "but it is our custom. You see, we are
      an unusual sort of publishing-house. We do not run after the best-sellers
      and the trash&mdash;we publish real books, books with a mission and a
      message for the world. And we advertise them widely&mdash;we make the
      world heed them; and so we feel justified in asking the author to help us
      with a part of the expense. We pay ten per cent. royalty, of course, and
      in addition the author has the hundred copies of his book, which he can
      sell to friends and others if he wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would it cost for my book?" Thyrsis asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man figured it up and told him it could be done for about two
      hundred and fifty dollars. "I'll make it two hundred and twenty-five to
      you," he said&mdash;"just because of my interest in your future."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thyrsis only shook his head sadly. "I wish I could do it," he said,
      "but I simply haven't the money&mdash;that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he took his departure, and carried his manuscript to another
      publisher, and then went home, crushed and sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. But the more Thyrsis thought of this plan, the more it came to
      possess him. If he could only get that book printed, it could not fail to
      make its impression! He had thought many times in his desperation of
      trying to publish it himself; and if he did that, he would have to pay the
      cost of the plates, of the printing and everything; whereas by this method
      he could get it for much less, and would have a hundred copies which he
      could send to critics and men of letters, in order to make certain of the
      book's being read.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the manuscript came back from the next publisher, with a formal note
      of rejection, Thyrsis made up his mind that he would concentrate his
      efforts upon this plan. So he got down to another pot-boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old sea-captain had told him a story of some American college boys who
      had stolen a sacred idol in China. Thyrsis saw a plot in that, and the
      editor of the "Treasure Chest" considered it a "bully" idea. So he toiled
      day and night for a couple more weeks, and earned another hundred dollars.
      And then he did something he had never done in his life before&mdash;he
      went to some relatives to beg. He pleaded how hard he had worked, and what
      a chance he had; he would pay back the money out of the first royalties
      from the book&mdash;which could not possibly fail to earn the hundred
      dollars he asked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, he had some money left from his first story; and so he went
      to Mr. Taylor, who was affable and enthusiastic as ever, and paid his
      money and signed the contracts. He was told that his book would be ready
      for the spring-trade; which meant that he would have to possess his soul
      in patience for three months. Meantime he had forty dollars left&mdash;upon
      which he figured that he could have eight weeks of uninterrupted study.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, for the best-laid plans of men! It was on a Tuesday morning that
      he paid out his precious two hundred and twenty-five dollars; and on the
      next Thursday morning, as he was glancing through the newspapers, he gave
      a cry of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon," he called. "What's the name of that lawyer, your trustee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John C. Hammond," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shot himself in his office yesterday!" exclaimed Thyrsis; and he read
      her the account, which stated that Hammond had been speculating, and was
      believed to have lost heavily in the recent slump in cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon was staring at him with terror in her eyes. "What does it mean?"
      she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Thyrsis. "We'll have to inquire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out and telephoned to Corydon's father, and Thyrsis got hold of
      a college friend, a lawyer, and the four went to the office of the dead
      man. It was weeks before they became sure of the whole sickening truth,
      but they learned enough on that first day to make them fairly certain.
      John C. Hammond had got rid of everything&mdash;not only his own funds,
      but the funds belonging to the eight or ten heirs of the estate. The house
      in which he lived and everything in it was held in the name of his wife;
      and so there was not a penny to pay Corydon her four thousand dollars!
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was almost prostrated with misery; she vowed that she would go
      back to her parents, that she would go to work in an office. And poor
      Thyrsis could only hold her in his arms and whisper, "It doesn't matter,
      dear&mdash;it doesn't matter! The book will be out in the spring, and I
      can do pot-boilers for two!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. But in the small hours of the night Thyrsis lay awake in his
      little room, and the soul within him was sick with horror. He was trapped&mdash;there
      was no use trying to dodge the fact, he was trapped! His powers were
      waning hour by hour, his vision was dying within him; every day he knew
      that he was weaker, that the grip of circumstance was tighter upon him.
      Ah, the hideous cruelty of the thing&mdash;it was like a murder in the
      night-time, like a torturing in some secret dungeon! He was burning up
      with his inward fires&mdash;there was a new book coming to ripeness within
      him, a book that would be greater even than his first one. And he could
      not write it, he could not even think about it! And there was the soul of
      Corydon calling to him, there were all the heights of music and poetry&mdash;and
      instead of climbing, he must torture his brain with hack-writing! He must
      go down to the editors, and fawn and cringe, and try to get books to
      review; he must study the imbecilities of the magazines and watch out for
      topics for articles; he must rack his brains for jokes and jingles&mdash;he,
      the master of life, the bearer of a new religion, the proud, high-soaring
      eagle, whose foot had never known a chain!
    </p>
    <p>
      When such thoughts came to him, he would dig his nails into the palms of
      his hands, he would grit his teeth and curse the world. No, they should
      not conquer him! They should never bend him to their will! They might
      starve him, they might kill him&mdash;they might kill Corydon, also, but
      he would never give up! He would fight, and fight again, he would struggle
      to the last gasp&mdash;he would do his work, though all the powers of hell
      rose up to stop him!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing became clear to him that night, they could not afford two rooms.
      They must get along with one, and with the dollar and a half one at that.
      The steam-radiator had proved a farce, anyway&mdash;there was never any
      steam, and they had had to use gas-heaters. And now, what things Corydon
      could not get into his room, she would have to send back to her parents.
      The cost of the other room was the price of a book-review, and that
      sometimes meant a whole day of his precious time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked it over with his wife, and she agreed with him. And so they
      underwent the humiliation of telling their landlady, and they obtained
      permission to keep Corydon's trunk in the hall, as there was no place for
      it in the tiny room. Such things as would not go upon the little
      dressing-stand, or hang behind the door, they put into boxes and shoved
      under the bed. And now, when midnight came, Thyrsis would go out for a
      walk while Corydon went to bed; and then he would come in and make his own
      bed upon the floor, with a quilt which the landlady had given them, and a
      pair of blankets they had borrowed from home, and his overcoat and some of
      Corydon's skirts when it was cold. Sometimes it would be very cold, and
      then he would have to sleep in his clothing; for there was no room save
      directly under the window, and they would not sleep with the window down.
      In the morning Corydon would turn her face to the wall while Thyrsis
      washed and dressed; and then he would go out and walk, while she took her
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he parted with the last shred of his isolation. He had to do all
      his work now with his wife in the room with him. And though she would sit
      as still as a mouse for hours, still he could not think as before; also,
      when she was worn out at night, he had to stop work and let her sleep.
      Under such circumstances it was small wonder that he was sometimes nervous
      and irritable; and, of course, there could be nothing hid between them,
      and when he was out of sorts, Corydon would be plunged into a bottomless
      pit of melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the strain and worry, and the night and day toil, began to have
      effects upon their health. Thyrsis had a strong constitution, but now he
      began to have headaches, and sometimes, if he worked on doggedly, they
      grew severe. He blamed this upon their heater; he knew little about
      hygiene, but he had studied physics, and he knew that a gas-heater
      devitalized the air. They had tried living in the room without heat, but
      in mid-winter they could not stand it. So on moderate days they would sit
      with the window up and their overcoats on; and when it was too cold for
      this, they would burn the heater for an hour or so, and when they began to
      feel the effects of the poisons, they would go out and walk for a while
      and let the room air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again, Thyrsis wondered if the headaches might not be due to the
      food he was eating. They were anxious to economize on food; but they did
      not know just how to set about it. Thyrsis had read the world's literature
      in English, French and German, in Italian, Latin and Greek; but in none of
      that reading had he found anything about the care of his own body. Such
      subjects had not been taught at school or college or university, and he
      knew of no books about them. Both he and Corydon had come from families
      which had the traditions of luxurious living, brought down from old days
      when there were plenty of negro servants, and when the ladies had been
      skilled in baking and preserving, and the men with chafing-dish and
      punch-bowl. At his grandfather's table Thyrsis had been wont to see a
      great platter of fried chicken at one end, and a roast beef at the other,
      and a cold ham on a side table; and he had hot bread three times a day,
      and cake and jam and ice-cream&mdash;and he had been taught to believe
      that such things were needed to keep up one's working-powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he had read how Thoreau had lived upon corn-meal mush; and he and
      Corydon resolved to patronize the less expensive foods. The price of meat
      and eggs and butter in the winter-time was in truth appalling; so they
      would buy potatoes and rice and corn-meal and prunes and turnips. They
      paid the landlady for the use of her gas-range, and would cook a sauce-pan
      full of some one of these things, and fill up with it three times a day.
      Then, at intervals, some one would invite them out to dinner; and because
      they were under-nourished they would gorge themselves&mdash;which was
      evidently not an ideal method of procedure. So in the end Thyrsis made up
      his mind to consult a physician about it; and this was a visit he never
      forgot&mdash;for it led directly to the most momentous events of his whole
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. The doctor announced that he had a little dyspepsia, and gave him
      a bottle full of a red liquid that would digest his food. Also he warned
      him to eat slowly, and to rest after meals. And Thyrsis, after thanking
      him, had started to go; when the doctor, who was an old friend of both
      families, asked the question, "How's Corydon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's pretty well," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you expecting any children yet?" asked the other, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis started. "Heavens, no!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We aren't going to have any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why? Are you preventing it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis hesitated a moment. "We're not living that way," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stared at him. "Come here, boy," he said, "and sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me what you mean," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that we&mdash;we're just brother and sister," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;why did you get married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We got married because we wanted to study."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To study what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, everything&mdash;music, principally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how long do you expect to keep that up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, for a good many years&mdash;until we've accomplished something, and
      until we've got some money."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the doctor sank back and drew his breath. "I don't wonder your
      stomach's out of order!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man did not answer that question. Instead he asked, "Don't you
      realize what you'll do to Corydon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll wreck her whole life&mdash;her health, to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how, doctor? She's perfectly happy. It's what we both want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But doesn't she love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;but not that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled. "How do you know?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;she's told me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if it was otherwise&mdash;do you think she'd tell you that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course she would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," said the man, "she'd die first!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was staring at him, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me tell you a little about a good woman," said the other. "I've been
      married for thirty years&mdash;really married, I mean; we've got five
      children. And in all those thirty years my wife has never made an advance
      of that sort to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After which the doctor went on to expound his philosophy of sex. "Love is
      just a little thing to you," he said; "you've got your books and your
      career. And you want it to be the same with Corydon&mdash;you've succeeded
      in persuading her that that's what she wants also. You're going to make
      her a copy of yourself! But you simply can't do it, boy&mdash;she's a
      woman. And a woman's one interest in the world is love&mdash;it's
      everything in life to her, the thing she's made for. And if you deprive
      her of love, whole love, I mean, you wreck her entirely. Just now is the
      time when she ought to be having her children, if she's ever to have any&mdash;and
      you're trying to satisfy her with music and philosophy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," cried Thyrsis, horrified, "I know she doesn't feel that way at
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe not," said the other. "Her eyes are not opened. It's your business
      to open them. What are you a man for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;she's all right as she is&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she nervous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she sometimes melancholy? And doesn't she like you to kiss her?
      Doesn't she show she's happy when you hold her in your arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sat mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see!" said the other, laughing. "The girl is in love with you, and
      you haven't sense enough to know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Thyrsis could find no words. "But if we had a child it would ruin
      us!" he cried, wildly. "I've not a cent, and my whole career's at stake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "if it's as bad as that, don't have any children
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but how <i>can</i> we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know how to control it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was staring at him, open-eyed. "Why, no!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good lord!" laughed the other. "Where have you been keeping yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the doctor proceeded to explain to him the "artificial
      sterilization of marriage." No whisper of such a thing had ever come to
      the boy before, and he could hardly credit his ears. But the doctor spoke
      of it as a man of the world, to whom it was a matter of course; he went
      into detail as to the various methods that people used. And when finally
      Thyrsis rose to leave he patted him indulgently on the shoulder, and
      laughed, "Go home to your wife, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. The effect of this conversation upon Thyrsis was alarming to him.
      At first he tried to put the thing aside, as being something utterly
      inconceivable between him and Corydon. But it would not be put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had planted his seed with cunning. If he had told Thyrsis that
      he was doing harm to himself, Thyrsis would have said that it was not
      true, and stood by it; for he knew about himself. But the man had made his
      statements about Corydon&mdash;and how could he be sure about Corydon?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crucial point was that it set him to thinking about her in this new
      way; a way which he had not dreamed of previously. And when once he had
      begun to think about her so, he found he could not stop. For hitherto in
      his life, whenever he had thought of passion it had been as a temptation;
      he had known that it was wrong, and all that was best in him had risen up
      to oppose it. But now all that was changed&mdash;the image of Corydon the
      doctor had called up was one that broke down all resistance, and left him
      at the mercy of his impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      These impulses awoke&mdash;and with a suddenness and force that terrified
      him. He thought of her as his wife, and this thought was like a rush of
      flame upon him. His manhood leaped up, and cried aloud for its rights. He
      discovered, almost instantly, that he loved her thus, that he desired her
      completely. This was true now, and it had been true from the beginning; he
      had been a fool to try to persuade himself otherwise. What else had been
      the meaning of the passionate protests in his letters to her? Of the
      images he had used&mdash;of carrying her away in his arms, of breaking her
      to his will? And she loved him, too&mdash;she desired him completely! Why
      else had it been that those passages were precisely the ones that
      satisfied her? Why was it that she was always most filled with joy when he
      was aggressive and masterful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah God, what an inhuman life it was they had been living all these months!
      In that inevitable proximity&mdash;shut up in a little room! And with the
      most intimate details of her life about him&mdash;with her kisses always
      upon his lips, her arms always about him, the subtle perfume of her
      presence always in his senses! Was it any wonder that they were nervous
      and restless&mdash;always sinking into tenderness, and exchanging
      endearments, and then starting up to scourge themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home, and there was Corydon preparing supper. He went to her and
      caught her in his arms and kissed her. "I love you, sweetheart!" he
      whispered. And as she yielded to his embraces, he kissed her again and
      again, upon her lips and upon her cheeks and upon her neck. Ah, she loved
      him&mdash;else how could she let him kiss her like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not so quickly that the inhibitions of a lifetime could be
      overcome. A sudden fear took hold of Thyrsis. What was he doing? No, she
      must have no idea of this&mdash;at least not until he had reasoned it out,
      until he had made up his mind that it was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he drew back&mdash;and as he did so he noticed in her eyes a look of
      surprise. He did not often greet her in that way!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm hungry as a bear," he said, to change the subject; and so they sat
      down to their supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had important writing to do that evening, and he tried his best,
      but he could not put his mind upon anything. He was all in a ferment. He
      pleaded that he had to think about his work, and went out for a long walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm was raging, and the icy gale beat upon him. It buffeted him, it
      flung him here and there; and he set himself to fight it, he drove his way
      through it, lusty and exultant. And music surged within him, lusty and
      exultant music. All the pent-up passion of his lifetime awoke in him, the
      blood ran hot in his veins; from some hidden portion of his being came
      wave after wave of emotion, sweeping him away&mdash;and he spread his
      wings to it, he rose to the heights upon it, he laughed and sang aloud in
      the glory of it. He had known such hours in his own soul's life, but never
      anything like it with Corydon. He cried out, what a child he had been! He
      had taken her, he had sought to shape her to his will; and he had failed,
      she was not yet his&mdash;and all because he had left unused the one great
      power he had over her, the one great hold he had upon her. But now it
      would be changed&mdash;she should have him! And as he battled on with the
      elements there came to him Goethe's poem of passion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Dem Schnee, dem Regen,
    Dem Wind entgegen!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 8. So for hours he went. But when he had come home, and stood in the
      vestibule, stamping the snow from him, there came a reaction. It was
      Corydon he had been thinking of&mdash;Corydon, the gentle and innocent!
      How could he say such things to her? How could he hint of them? Why, he
      would fill her with terror! It was not to be thought of!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went upstairs, and found that she was asleep. So he crept into his
      little bunk; but sleep would not come to him. The image of her haunted
      him. He listened to her breathing&mdash;he was as close to her as that,
      and still she was not his!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly day before he slept, and so he awoke tired and restless. And
      then came rage at himself&mdash;he went out and walked again, and stormed
      and scolded. He would not permit this, he had work to do. And he made up
      his mind that he would not allow himself to think about the matter for
      three days. By that time the truth would be clearer to him; and he meant
      to settle this question with his reason, and not with his blind desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He adhered to his resolution firmly. But when the three days were past,
      and he tried to think about it, it was only to be swept away in another
      storm of emotion. It seemed that the more tightly he pent this river up,
      the fiercer was its rush when finally it broke loose. For always his will
      was paralyzed by that suggestion that he might be doing harm to Corydon!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he made up his mind that he must speak to her; and one afternoon
      he came and knelt beside her and put his arms about her. "Sweetheart," he
      said, "I've something to ask you about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to Corydon the mind of Thyrsis was like an open book. For days she had
      known that something was disturbing him. But also she had known that he
      was not ready to tell her. "What is it?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's something very important," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, I went to see the doctor the other day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he told me&mdash;he thinks we are doing each other harm by the way we
      are living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What way, Thyrsis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By not being really married. He says you are suffering because of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis!" she cried, in astonishment. "I'm not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says you wouldn't know it, Corydon. It would keep you nervous and
      upset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But dear," she said, "I'm perfectly happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;and if it was ever otherwise&mdash;you would tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you sure of <i>that</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; and when she tried to answer, her voice was a whisper&mdash;"I
      think so, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "Thyrsis," she exclaimed, suddenly, "I would have a
      child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you needn't," he said; and he told her what the doctor had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite as new to her as it had been to him, and even more startling.
      "I see," she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Corydon," he whispered, "do you think you love me at all that
      way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she answered. "I never thought of such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you could learn to love me so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell, Thyrsis? It's so strange to me. It&mdash;it frightens
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her; and he saw that a flush was mottling her throat, and
      spreading over her cheeks. He saw the wild look in her eyes also; and he
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, dearest," he said. "I don't want to disturb you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he tried to go back to his work. But he could not do his real work at
      all. He could practice the violin or read German with Corydon, but when he
      tried to plan his new book&mdash;that involved turning his thoughts loose
      to graze in a certain pasture, and they would not stay in that pasture,
      but jumped the fence and came back to her. And so he found himself taking
      more long journeys, in which he walked in the midst of the storm of his
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, of course, all the former naturalness was gone between them. No longer
      could they kiss and toy with one another as children in a fairy-world.
      They had suddenly become man and woman&mdash;fighting the age-long duel of
      sex. They would talk about the question; and the more they talked about
      it, the more it came to dominate the thoughts of both of them; and this
      broke down the barriers between them&mdash;Thyrsis became bolder, and more
      open in his speech. He lost his awe of her maidenhood and her innocence&mdash;he
      wooed her, he lured her on; he rejoiced in his power to agitate her, to
      startle her, to speak to her about secret things. He would clasp her in
      his arms and shower his kisses upon her; and she would yield to him,
      almost fainting with bliss&mdash;and then shrink from him in sudden alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he would go out into the night and battle again with the wintry
      winds. That frightened shrinking of hers puzzled him. Everything was so
      strange to him; and how could he be sure what was right? He wanted to do
      what was right, with all his soul he wanted it; if he were to do wrong, or
      to make her think less of him, he could never forgive himself all his
      life. But then would come the wild surge of his longing, and his man's
      power would cry out within him. It was his business to overcome her
      shrinking, to compel her to yield. The question of the doctor rang in his
      ears as a taunt&mdash;"Why are you a man?" Why <i>was</i> he a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. In the end these emotions reached a point where Thyrsis could no
      longer bear them. They were a torment to him, they deprived him of all
      rest and sleep. One afternoon he had held her a long time in his arms, and
      it hurt him; he turned away, and put his hands to his forehead. "Dearest,"
      he cried, "I can't stand this any longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she asked. "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean it's just tearing me to pieces!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him in fright. "Thyrsis!" she exclaimed. "You are unhappy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sunk down upon the bed and hid his face in his arms. "Yes," he
      whispered, "I am unhappy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, all at once, he broke down her resistance. What had swayed him had
      been the thought of her suffering; and the thought of his suffering now
      conquered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only she did not take days to debate it. She fled to him instantly, and
      wrapped her arms about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she whispered, "listen to me! I had no idea of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sweetheart," he said. "I'm sorry&mdash;I'm ashamed of myself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" she cried, vehemently. "Don't say that! I love you, Thyrsis! I
      love you, heart and soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and gazed at her with his haggard eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything for you," she rushed on. "You shall have me! I will be
      your wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, however, as he clasped her to him, there came once more the
      shrinking. "Only give me a little time, dear," she whispered. "Let me get
      used to it. Let it come naturally."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the only way he could have given her time would have been to go away.
      Here he was, in her room&mdash;with every reminder of her about him, with
      every incitement to his desire. And he had but two things to choose
      between&mdash;to go out and walk and think about her, or to come home and
      sit with her and talk about their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had their supper, and then again she was in his arms. He told her
      about this trouble&mdash;he showed how the love of her was consuming him.
      Far into the night they sat talking, and he poured out his heart to her,
      he bore her with him to the mountain-tops of his desire. He took down a
      book of Spenser's, and read her the "Epithalamium"; he read her Shelley's
      "Epip sychidion," which they both loved. All the power of Thyrsis' genius
      was turned now to passion, and the hidden forces of him were revealed as
      never had they been revealed to her before. He became eloquent; he talked
      to her as he had lived with himself; he awed her and frightened her, as he
      had that evening upon the hill-top. Then at last, as the tide of his
      feeling swept him away again, he clasped her to him tightly, and hid his
      face in her neck. "I love you! Oh, I love you!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sunk back and closed her eyes. "My Thyrsis!" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love me?" he asked. "You are quite sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite sure!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her; again and again he kissed her, until he had made sure of
      her desire. Then suddenly, he began with trembling fingers to unfasten the
      neck of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she did not comprehend what he meant. Then she gave a start.
      "Thyrsis!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she sprang up, staring at him with fright in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" she gasped. "What&mdash;what were you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And at her question, shame swept over him. He was horrified at himself.
      How could he find words to tell her what he had been going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away with a moan, and put his hands over his face. "Oh God, I
      can't stand this!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he went to his hat and coat. "I must go out!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" cried Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean I've got to go somewhere!" he replied. "I can't stand it&mdash;I
      can't stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" she cried, wildly. And she sprang to him and flung her arms
      about him. "No, no!" she cried. "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait! Wait!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pressed him tightly to her. "Thyrsis!" she whispered. "Can't you
      understand? Don't be so stupid, dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stupid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sweetheart&mdash;can't you see? I'm only a child! And it's so
      strange! It frightens me! Try to realize how I feel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do? Why you must <i>make</i> me, Thyrsis!" And as she said this she hid
      her face upon his shoulder and sobbed. "You are a man, Thyrsis, you are a
      man, and I am only a girl! Do what you want to! Don't pay any attention to
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And those words to Thyrsis were like the crashing of a peal of thunder. He
      clutched her to him, with a force that crushed her, that made her cry out.
      The soul of the cave-man awoke in him&mdash;he lifted his mate in his arms
      and bore her away to a secret place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put down the light," she whispered, and he did this. And then again he
      began to unfasten her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She submitted at first, she let him have his way. But later, when his
      hands touched the soft garment on her bosom, he felt a sharp tremor pass
      through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait dear, wait!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why wait?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a moment&mdash;please, dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he answered her&mdash;"No! Not a moment! No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him, trembling, pleading. "Please, dearest, please! I'm
      afraid, Thyrsis."
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing could stop him now. She was his&mdash;his to do what he
      pleased with! And he would bend her to his will! The voice of his manhood
      shouted aloud to him now, and it was like the clashing of wild cymbals in
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on with what he was doing. She shrunk away from him, but he
      followed her, he held her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to sob&mdash;"Oh Thyrsis, wait&mdash;spare me! I can't bear
      it! No, Thyrsis&mdash;no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he answered her, "Be still! I love you! You are mine." And for every
      sob and every shudder and every moan of fear he had but one response&mdash;"I
      love you! You are mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he loved her now&mdash;and he knew what his love meant.
      Before this they had been strangers; but now he would penetrate to the
      secret places, to the holy of holies of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in all his life had Thyrsis known woman. To him woman had been the
      supreme mystery of life, a creature of awe and sacredness&mdash;not to be
      handled, scarcely even to be thought about. Now the awful ban was lifted,
      the barriers were down; what had been hidden was revealed, what had been
      forbidden was permitted. So all the chained desire of a lifetime drove him
      on; it was almost more than he could bear. The touch of her warm breasts,
      the faint perfume of her clothing, the pressure of her soft, white limbs&mdash;these
      things set every nerve of him a-tremble, they turned a madness loose in
      him. A blinding whirl of emotion seized him, he was like a leaf swept away
      in a gale; his words came now in wild sobs, "I love you! I love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So with quivering fingers he stripped her before him; and she crouched
      there, cowering and weeping. He took her in his arms; and that clasp there
      was no misunderstanding, for all the mastery of his will was in it. Nor
      did she try to resist him&mdash;she lay still, but shaking like a leaf,
      and choking with sobs. And so it was that he wreaked his will upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. And then came the reaction&mdash;the most awful experience of
      his life. Thyrsis was sitting upon the bed, and staring in front of him,
      dazed. He was exhausted, faint, shuddering with horror. "Oh, my God, my
      God!" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he done? Corydon, the gentle and pure&mdash;she had trusted
      herself to him, and how had he treated her? He had tortured her, he had
      defiled her! Oh, it was sickening; brutal, like a butchery! He sunk down
      in a heap, moaning, "My God! I can't bear it! I can't bear it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a strange thing happened&mdash;the strangest of all strange
      things! An unforeseeable, an unimaginable thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon had started up, and was listening; and now suddenly he felt her
      arms stealing about him. "Thyrsis!" she whispered. "Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what shall I do?" he sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it was so horrible! horrible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" she panted, swiftly. "Don't say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I have done it?" he rushed on. "What a monster I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no!" she cried. "You don't understand, I love you! Don't you know
      that I love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she tightened her clasp about him, she stole into his arms again.
      "Forgive me!" she whispered. "Please, please&mdash;forgive me, Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, dazed. "Forgive <i>you</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no right to behave like that!" she cried. "I was afraid&mdash;I
      couldn't control myself. But oh, Thyrsis, I love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pressed herself upon him convulsively; she was troubled no longer.
      "Yes!" she panted. "Yes! I don't mind it any more! I am yours! I am yours!
      You may do whatever you please to me, Thyrsis&mdash;I love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered him with kisses&mdash;his face, his neck, his body. She drew
      him down to her again, whispering in ecstasy, "<i>My husband!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lost in amazement. Could this be Corydon, the gentle and shrinking?
      No, she was gone; and in her stead this creature of desire&mdash;tumultuous
      and abandoned! She was like some passion-goddess out of the East,
      shameless and terrible and destroying! She was like a tigress of the
      jungle, calling in the night for its mate. She locked him fast in her arms&mdash;she
      was swept away in a whirlwind of emotion, as he had been swept before. And
      all her being rose up in one song of exultation&mdash;"Mine! Mine! Mine!
      Mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Thyrsis!" she cried. "My Thyrsis! I belong to you now! You can never
      escape me now! You can never leave me&mdash;my love, my love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Thyrsis listened to this song, his passion died. Reason awoke
      again, and a cold fear struck into his heart! What was the meaning of <i>this?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Long hours afterward, as she lay, half-asleep, in his arms, she felt him
      give a sudden start and shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," he said&mdash;"I just happened to think of something. Something
      that frightened me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking, dear&mdash;<i>suppose I should become domestic!</i>"

      them. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thou art gone! And round me too the night In ever-nearing circle
      weaves her shade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" she said, and smiled sadly. "Where is he gone?"

      And she turned the page and read again&mdash;

   "But Thyrsis nevermore we swains shall see;

      Section 1. It was a tiny cupboard of a room in a tenement. They sat upon
      their bed to eat, and they hid their soiled dishes beneath it. Dirty
      children screamed upon the avenue in front, and frowsy-headed women and
      wolfish men caroused in the saloon below. Yet here there came to them the
      angel with the flame-tipped wings, and here they dreamed their dream of
      wonder.

      In the glory of their new-found passion all life became transfigured to
      them; they discovered new meaning in the most trivial actions. There was
      no corner so obscure that they might not come upon the young god hidden;
      they might touch his warm, tender flesh, and hear his silvery laughter,
      and thrill with the wonder of his presence. They spoke a new language,
      full of fire and color; they read new meanings in each other's eyes. The
      slightest touch of hand upon hand, or of lips to lips, was enough to
      dissolve them in tenderness and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rejoiced in the marvel of each other's being&mdash;in the glory of
      their bodies, newly revealed. To Thyrsis especially this was life's last
      miracle, a discovery so fraught with bliss as to be a continual torment.
      The incitements that were hidden in the softness and the odor of unbound
      and tumbled hair; the exquisiteness of maiden breasts, moulded of marble,
      rosy-tipped; the soft contour of snowy limbs, the rhythmic play of moving
      muscles&mdash;to dwell amid these things, to possess them, was suddenly to
      discover in reality what before had only existed in the realm of painting
      and sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon also, in the glow of his delight, of his rapture and his ravening
      desire, discovered anew the wonder of herself, and came to a new
      consciousness of her beauty. She would stand and gaze before her, with her
      hands upon her breasts, and her head flung back and her eyes closed in
      ecstasy, so that he might come to her and kiss her&mdash;might kiss her
      again and again, might touch her with his lover's hands and clasp her with
      his lover's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most of these things she was his teacher. For Corydon was one person,
      in body, mind and soul; in her there were no disharmonies, no warring
      elements. His friend the doctor had set forth his idea of "a good woman";
      but Corydon's goodness proved to be after no such pattern. Now that she
      was his, she was his; she belonged to him, she was a part of him, and
      there could be no thought of a secret shame, of any reserves or
      hesitations. Her body was herself, and it was joy to her; it was joy the
      more, because she could give it for love; and she sought for new ways to
      utter the completeness of her giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was like a little child about it&mdash;so free, so spontaneous, so
      genuine; Thyrsis marvelled at her utter naturalness. For himself, in the
      midst of these things, there was always a sense of the strange and the
      terrible, a sense of penetrating to forbidden mysteries; but Corydon
      laughed in the sunlight of utter bliss&mdash;and she laughed most at him,
      when she found that her simple language had startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the maiden out of ancient Greece was now become a lover! And so she
      was revealed to Thyrsis&mdash;she who might have marched in the
      Panathenaic processions, with one of the sacred vessels in her hands, or
      run in the Attic games, bare-limbed and fearless. So he learned to think
      of her, singing in the myrtle groves Of Mount Hymettus, or walking naked
      in the moonlight in Arcadian meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he thought of her all through her life, whenever a moment of joy came
      to her&mdash;whenever, for instance, she found her way to the water. They
      had dressed her in long skirts and put her in a drawing-room&mdash;but
      Corydon had got to the water in spite of them; and all that any Nereid had
      ever known, that she had known from the time the waves first kissed her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was also with love; she was born to be a priestess of love's
      religion. She had waited for this hour&mdash;that she might take his hand,
      and lead him into the temple, and teach him the ritual. It was a ministry
      that she entered upon with the joy of all her being. "Ah, let me teach you
      how to love!" she would cry. "Ah, let me teach you how to love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Love was to her an utter blending of two selves, the losing of one's
      personality in another's; it meant the forgetting of one's self, and all
      the ends of self. And Thyrsis marvelled at the glory that came upon her,
      at each new rapture she discovered. All the language of lovers was known
      to her, all the songs of lovers were upon her lips:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Du bist mir ewig,
    Bist mir immer&mdash;
    Erb und Eigen
    Ein und All!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Such was her woman's gift: precious beyond all treasures of earth, and
      given without price or question. And Thyrsis trembled as he realized it;
      he lived upon his knees before her, and floods of tenderness welled up in
      his heart. How utterly she trusted him, how completely she belonged to
      him! And what could he do to show himself worthy of it&mdash;this most
      wonderful dream of his life come true&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "If someone should give me a heart to keep,
    With love for the golden key!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Yet, amid all these raptures, Thyrsis was haunted by ghosts of doubt.
      Would he be able to do what his heart yearned to do? Love meant so much to
      her&mdash;and could it mean that much to him? Why could it not be to him
      the complete thing it was to her&mdash;why must he argue and wonder and
      fear?
    </p>
    <p>
      For Thyrsis' ancestors had not dallied in Arcadian meadows. They had come
      from the wilds of Palestine and the deserts of Northern Africa; they had
      argued and wondered and feared in Gothic cloisters, in New England
      meeting-houses; and the shadow of their souls hung over him still. He
      could not love love as Corydon loved it, he could not trust it as she
      trusted it. It could never seem to him the utterly natural thing&mdash;there
      was always a fear of pollution, a hint of satiety, a thrill of shame.
      Directly the first fires of passion had spent themselves, these anxieties
      came to him; he remembered how in his virgin youth he had thought of
      passion&mdash;as of something strange and uncomfortable, even grotesque,
      suggesting too closely a kinship with the animals. So he noticed that his
      feelings always waned before Corydon's. She wished him to linger&mdash;love
      meant so much to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then too, the code of passion was all unknown to him. What was right and
      what was wrong? When should one yield to desire, and when should one
      restrain it? To Corydon such questions never came&mdash;to her there was
      no such possibility as excess; she was complete and perfect, and nature
      told her. If there were temptations and restraints and regrets, they were
      for Thyrsis; and he had to keep them for his own secret, he could ask no
      help from her. For he discovered immediately that with his proud
      imperiousness, he could not endure to have Corydon refuse herself to him.
      So this laid a new burden upon him, an appalling one. For were they not
      always together&mdash;her lips always calling him, the impulse towards her
      always with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another circumstance&mdash;the means they had to take to prevent
      the consequences of their love. From the very first, Thyrsis had shrunk
      from the thought of this; but it was only later that he realized how much
      it repelled him. It offended all his sense of economy and purpose; it was
      something done, and at the same time undone&mdash;and so it had in it the
      essence of all futility and wrongness. It took from passion its meaning
      and its excuse; and yet he could not say this to Corydon; and he knew also
      that he could no longer do without her. He was bound&mdash;bound fast! And
      every hour his chains would become tighter; what was now spontaneous joy
      would become a habit&mdash;a thing like eating and sleeping, a new and
      humiliating necessity of the flesh!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Such were their problems. They might have solved them all,
      perhaps&mdash;had they only had time. But others came crowding upon them,
      others still more insistent and perplexing. The world was pressing them,
      jealous of their dream of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their little fund of money was gone, and so Thyrsis went back to his
      hack-work. All day he sat by the window and slaved at it, while Corydon
      lay upon the bed and read, or wandered about the park by herself. Thyrsis'
      burden was twice as heavy now, for he had to earn for two; and when in the
      ecstasies of love she cried out to him that she was his forever, the cruel
      mockery of circumstance translated this to mean that he would forever have
      to earn for two!
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote more book-reviews, and peddled them about; sometimes he was
      forced to exchange them for books he reviewed, and then to sell the books
      for twenty or thirty cents apiece. He wrote up some ideas for political
      cartoons, and got three dollars for one of them. He wrote a parody upon a
      popular poem, and got six dollars for that. He met a college friend, just
      returned from a trip in the Andes, and he patiently collected the material
      for a narrative, and sold it to a minor magazine for fifteen dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile he toiled furiously at another pot-boiler, a tale of
      Hessians and Tories and a red-cheeked and irresistible revolutionary
      heroine, to fill the insatiable maw of the readers of the "Treasure
      Chest." On one occasion, when everything went wrong, Corydon took the
      half-dozen solid silver coffee-spoons and the heavy gold-plated
      berry-spoon which had constituted her outfit of wedding-presents, and sold
      them to a nearby jeweler for two dollars and a quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But through all this bitter struggle they looked forward to a glorious
      ending. In April the book would be out&mdash;and then they would be free!
      They would go away to the country&mdash;perhaps to the little cabin of
      last summer! Ah, how they dreamed of that cabin, how they hungered for it!
      They pictured it, covered in snow, with the ice-bound brook in front of it&mdash;both
      the cabin and the brook asleep, and dreaming of the spring-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was dreaming of it also, with tears in his eyes and a mighty
      passion in his heart; for his new book was calling to him&mdash;he had to
      fight hard to keep it from taking possession of his thoughts and driving
      the pot-boilers out of the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the joyful excitement of reading the proofs of his book; also
      of inspecting the cover-design, and the sample of the paper, and the
      "dummy". And then&mdash;it was two weeks from now! Then it was only ten
      days&mdash;then only one week. And finally the raptures of the first
      sample copy!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time the publishers had begun to advertise it, and Thyrsis went to
      see Mr. Taylor about the matter. Mr. Taylor was vague in his replies. Then
      came publication-day, and still no advertisements; and Thyrsis called
      again, and insisted and expostulated, and learned to his consternation
      that they were not going to advertise it; the season was a bad one, the
      firm had met with unexpected expenses, and so on. When Thyrsis reminded
      them of their promises, and threatened and stormed, Mr. Taylor informed
      him quietly that there was nothing in the contract about advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went home, and tried to forget his rage in the work of
      disposing of his hundred copies. He had prepared himself for the
      possibility of everything else failing, but here he had a plan whereby he
      felt that his deliverance was assured. He had made up a list of a hundred
      of the best-known men of letters in the country&mdash;college presidents
      and professors, editors and clergymen, novelists and poets and critics;
      and he had done more hack-work, and earned the twenty dollars it would
      take to send to each of them a copy of the book, together with his
      manifesto, and a little type-written note. This, he felt, would make
      certain of the book's being read; and once let the book be read by the
      real leaders of the country's thought, and his siege would be at an end!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the packages went to the post-office, freighted with the burden of his
      hopes and longings. And two or three times a week Thyrsis went to see his
      publishers, and find out how the book was going. He was never able to
      ascertain just what they were doing with it, or how they expected to sell
      it; Mr. Taylor would tell him vaguely that it was doing fairly well&mdash;the
      season was "slow", and he must give the book time to "catch on".
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the reviews. A clipping-bureau had written, offering to
      furnish them at five cents apiece; and this was moderate, considering that
      there were only a dozen altogether. Most of these were from unimportant
      out-of-town papers, whose book-reviews are written by the high-school
      nieces and the elderly maiden-aunts of the publishers. Of the metropolitan
      newspapers and literary organs, only three noticed the book at all; and
      two of these gave perfunctory mention, evidently made up from the
      publisher's statement on the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third writer had connected the book with the interview in the "Morning
      Howl", and he wrote a burlesque review of it, in which he hailed it as the
      "Great American Novel". His method was to retell the story, quoting the
      most highly-wrought passages, with just enough comment to keep it in the
      vein of farce. To Thyrsis this mockery came like a blast of fire in the
      face; he did not know that it was the regular method of the newspaper&mdash;a
      method by means of which it had made itself known as the cleverest and
      most readable paper in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. All this was the harder for him, because it came at a black and
      spectral hour of his life. It was not enough that the book was falling
      flat, and that all their hopes were collapsing; a new and most terrible
      calamity befell them. For three months now they had been dissolved in the
      bliss of their young dream of love; and now suddenly had come a
      thunderbolt, splitting the darkness about them, and revealing the grim
      hand of Fate closing down!
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years of her life Corydon had carried a trying burden&mdash;once
      each month she would have to lie down for three or four days and be a
      semi-invalid. And last month this had not happened; the time had come and
      gone, and she was as well as ever. She had told Thyrsis about it, and how
      it disturbed her; it might mean nothing, it had happened several times
      before to her; but then again&mdash;it might mean that she had conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea had been too frightful to contemplate, however, and they had put
      it aside. It was not possible&mdash;the doctor had told them how to
      prevent it; he had told them that "everybody" did it, and that they could
      feel safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now came the second month; and Corydon, filled with a vague terror,
      waited for the day. And horrible beyond all telling&mdash;the day came and
      went once more! And two days came&mdash;three days! And so finally Corydon
      went to see the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came home again, and entered the room, Thyrsis saw it all in her
      face, without her uttering a word. He went sick, all at once; and Corydon
      sank down upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he asked, in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said&mdash;he said I was in splendid shape, and that I would have a
      fine baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis stared at her, and then suddenly burst into wild laughter, and
      hid his head in his arms. Such was their mood that she could not feel sure
      whether he was laughing or crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, indeed, they were facing the reality of life. All the problems with
      which they had ever wrestled were as child's play to this problem; they
      could sit and read the deadly terror in each other's eyes. Corydon's lip
      was trembling, and her face was white and drawn and old. So swiftly had
      fled her young dream of joy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she said, in a low voice, "it means ruin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she clenched her hands tightly. "I will kill myself first!" she
      whispered. "I will not drag you down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Thyrsis," she went on. "There is only one thing to be thought of.
      I must get rid of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get rid of it?" he echoed. "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she said. "But women often do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard of it," he replied. "But isn't it dangerous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she said, "and I don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you ask the doctor?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor? There was no use us asking him, Thyrsis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;he doesn't understand. He likes babies. That's his
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      They argued this. But in the end Thyrsis resolved that he must see the
      doctor himself. He must see him if it was only to pour out his anguish. It
      was the doctor's fault that this fearful accident had befallen them!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy soon saw that it was as Corydon had said, there was nothing to
      be gained in that quarter. Babies were indeed the doctor's business; they
      were the business of the whole world, from his point of view. People got
      married to have babies; they were in the world to have babies, and
      anything else was just nonsense. Nowadays babies were the only excuse that
      people had for living&mdash;their morality began and ended with them.
      Moreover, babies were fine in themselves; they were beautiful and fat and
      jolly. The pagan old gentleman sang a very paean in praise of babies&mdash;the
      more of them there were, the more laughter upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, having them was the business of women&mdash;that, and not reading
      German poetry and playing the piano. They all made a little fuss at the
      outset, but then they submitted, and they soon found that Nature knew more
      than they. Babies completed women's lives, they settled their nerves; they
      gave them something to think about, and saved them from hysteria and
      extravagance and sentimentalism, and all the rest of the ills of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the doctor fixed his keen eyes upon him. "Are you and Corydon
      thinking about an abortion?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't know," stammered Thyrsis. The word sounded ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got that impression from her," said the other. "And now let me tell you&mdash;if
      you do that, it'll be something you'll never forgive yourself for as long
      as you live. In the first place, you may lose your wife. It's a very
      dangerous thing, and a woman is seldom the same after it. You might make
      it impossible for her ever to have a child again, and so blast her whole
      life. You'll have to trust her in the hands of some vile scoundrel&mdash;you
      understand, of course, that it's a crime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a crime not only against the law&mdash;it's a crime against God. And
      it's the curse of our age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with Corydon, anyway?" demanded the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's so young!" cried Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! She's nineteen now, isn't she? And she couldn't be in better
      condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she's so undeveloped&mdash;mentally, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing in the world will develop her like maternity. And can't
      you see that she wants the baby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wants it!" shouted Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course! She's dead in love with you, boy. And she wants the baby!
      Why shouldn't she have it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only make you understand&mdash;" protested Thyrsis, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" exclaimed the doctor. "That's what they all say! Not a day passes
      that some woman doesn't sit in this office and say it! Each case is
      different from any other case that ever was or could be. They tell me how
      much they suffer, and what a state their nerves are in, and how busy they
      are, and how poor they are&mdash;their social duties, and their artistic
      duties, and their religious duties, and their philanthropic duties! And
      they weep and wring their hands, and tell me agonizing stories, and they
      offer me any sum I could ask&mdash;many a time I might earn a thousand
      dollars by something that wouldn't take me ten minutes, if only I didn't
      have a conscience!&mdash;Go away, boy, and get those ideas out of your
      head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. So Thyrsis went away, with a new realization of the seriousness
      of his position, with a new sense of the grip in which he was fast. It was
      a conspiracy of Nature, a conspiracy of all the world! It was a Snare!
    </p>
    <p>
      All through this love-adventure, even when most under the sway of his
      emotions, Thyrsis' busy mind had been groping and reaching for an
      understanding of it. Little by little this had come to him&mdash;and now
      the picture was complete. He had beheld the last scene of the panorama; he
      had got to the moral of the tale!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been the sport of cosmic forces, of the blind and irresistible
      reproductive impulse of Nature. Step by step he had been driven, he had
      played his part according to the plan. He had hesitated and debated and
      resolved and decided&mdash;thinking that he had something to do with it
      all! But now he looked back, and saw himself as a leaf swept along by a
      torrent. And all the while the torrent had known its destination! He had
      had many plans and many purposes, but always Nature had had but one plan
      and one purpose&mdash;which was the Child!
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve months ago Thyrsis had been a boy, carefree and happy, rapt in his
      dream of art; and now here he was, a married man, with the cares of
      parenthood on his shoulders! If anyone had told him that a trick could be
      played upon him, he would have laughed at them. How confident he had been&mdash;how
      certain of his mastery of life! And now he was in the Snare!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismayed as he was, Thyrsis could not but smile as he realized it. The
      artist in him appreciated the technique of the performance. How cunningly
      it had all been managed&mdash;how cleverly the device had been hidden how
      shrewdly the bait had been selected!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back over the adventure. What a fuss he and Corydon had made about
      it! What a vast amount of posturing and preluding, of backing and filling!
      And how solemnly they had taken it&mdash;how earnestly they had believed
      in the game! What convictions had weighed upon them, what exaltations had
      thrilled them&mdash;two pitiful little puppets, set here and there by
      unseen hands! Rehearsing from prologue to curtain the age-long drama, the
      drama of Sex that had been played from the beginning of the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      He marvelled at the prodigality that Nature had displayed&mdash;at the
      treasures she had squandered to accomplish her purpose! She would create a
      million eggs to make one salmon; and she had created a million emotions to
      make one baby! What poems she had written for them&mdash;what songs she
      had composed for them! She had emptied the cornucopiae of her gifts into
      their lap! She had strewn the pathway with roses before them, she had
      filled their mouths with honey, and their ears with the sound of sweet
      music; she had blinded them, she had stunned them, she had sent them
      drunken and reeling to their fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the elaborate set of pretenses and illusions that she had invented for
      them! The devices to lull their suspicions&mdash;the virtues and
      renunciations, the humilities and the consecrations! Corydon had been
      frightened and evasive; Nature had made him suffer, so as to break her
      down! And he had been proud and defiant; and so Corydon, the meek and
      gentle, had been turned into a heroine of revolt! Nay, worse than that;
      those very powers and supremacies that he had thought were his protection&mdash;were
      they not, also, a part of the Snare? His culture and his artistry, his
      visions and his exaltations&mdash;what had they been but a lure for the
      female? The iris of the burnished dove, the ruff about the grouse's neck,
      the gold and purple of the butterfly's wing! Even his genius, his
      miraculous, ineffable genius&mdash;that had been the plume of the
      partridge, the crowning glory before which his mate had capitulated!
    </p>
    <p>
      These images came to Thyrsis, until he burst into wild, sardonic laughter.
      He saw himself in new and grotesque lights; he was the peacock, spreading
      his gorgeousness before a dazzled and wondering world; he was the young
      rooster, strutting before his mate, and thrilling with the knowledge of
      his own importance! He was each of the barnyard creatures by turn, and
      Corydon was each of the fascinated females. And somewhere, perhaps, stood
      the farmer, smiling complacently&mdash;for should there not be somewhere a
      farmer in this universal barnyard?
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, the laughter died; for he thought of Maeterlinck's "Life of the
      Bee", and shuddered at the fate of the male-creature. He was a mere
      accident in the scheme of Nature&mdash;she wasted all his splendors to
      accomplish the purpose of an hour. And now it had been accomplished. He
      had had his moment of ecstasy, his dizzy flight into the empyrean; and now
      behold him falling, disembowelled and torn, an empty shell!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no&mdash;it was not quite that way, Thyrsis told himself, after
      further reflection. In the human hive the male creature was not only the
      bearer of the seed he was also the worker. And so there was one more
      function he had to perform. All those fine frenzies of his, his ideals and
      his enthusiasms&mdash;they had served their purpose, and would fade; but
      before him there was still a future&mdash;a drab and dreary future of
      perpetual pot-boiling!
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled their bridal-night. All that had puzzled him in it and
      startled him&mdash;how clear it was now! Corydon had shrunk from him, just
      enough to lure him; and then, suddenly, her whole being had seemed to
      change&mdash;she had caught him, and held him fast. For he had
      accomplished her purpose; he had gotten her with child! And so he must
      stand by her&mdash;he must bring her food, that she might give the child
      life! And for that purpose she would hold him; for that she would use
      every art of which she was mistress&mdash;the whole force of her being
      would go into it!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not know this, of course; she would do it blindly and
      instinctively, as she had done everything so far. She would do it by those
      same generous and beautiful qualities that had made him hers! Therein lay
      the humor of his whole adventure&mdash;there lay the deadly nature of this
      Snare. The cords of it were woven out of love and tenderness, out of
      ecstasy and aspiration; and they were wound about his very heart-strings,
      so that it would kill him to pull them loose. And he would never pull them
      loose&mdash;he saw that in a sudden vision of ruin! She would be noble to
      the uttermost limit of nobleness. She would threaten to destroy herself&mdash;and
      so he would save her! She would bid him cast her away&mdash;and so he
      would stand by her to the end! And the end would be simply the withering
      and shrivelling of those radiant qualities which he called his genius&mdash;qualities
      which were so precious to him, but about which Nature knew nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      So grim an aspect had life come to wear to this boy of twenty-one! He
      stripped all the flesh of illusion from its fair face, and saw the
      grinning skull beneath. And he mocked at himself, because of all those
      virtues by which he had been caught&mdash;and which yet he knew were
      stronger than his will. Through faith and love he had been made a captive;
      and through faith and love would he waste away and perish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. Meantime, Corydon was prosecuting an inquiry into these matters
      upon her own account, and getting at quite other points of view. There
      were some, it seemed, who took this game less seriously than she and
      Thyrsis; and these managed to go free&mdash;they broke the cords of the
      Snare, they slipped between the fingers of the hand of Fate. Corydon had
      heard a certain scientist refer to man as "Nature's insurgent son"; and
      now came the discovery that Nature had insurgent daughters also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in an "interesting condition," Corydon was entitled to the
      confidences of the married women acquaintances of the family. They were
      eager to know all about her, and what she was going to do; and they told
      her their own experiences. She brought these to Thyrsis, who was thus
      admitted to a view of the inner workings of the "race-suicide" mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as the doctor had said; each one of these middle-class ladies
      considered herself a special case, but their stories all seemed to fit
      together. Nature's boundless and irrational fecundity was an exceedingly
      trying feature of the life of middle-class ladies. In the first place, the
      having of babies was a tedious and painful matter. One became grotesquely
      disfigured, and had to hide away and sever all social relationships. One
      lost one's grace and attractiveness, and hence the power to hold one's
      husband. And then, there were all the cares and the inconveniences of
      children. What was one to do with them, in a city where the best hotels
      and apartment-houses barred them out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, even supposing the best of intentions&mdash;there was the cost
      of living. At present prices it was impossible for a man who had only a
      salary to support more than one or two children; and with prices
      increasing as they were, one could not be sure of educating even these.
      And meanwhile, the Nature of Things had apparently planned it that a woman
      should bear a child once a year for half her life-time!
    </p>
    <p>
      So all these middle-class ladies used devices to prevent conception. But
      these were not always successful&mdash;husbands were frequently
      inconsiderate. And so came the abortion-business, which the doctor had
      described as the curse of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then one could accomplish the thing by some of the innumerable
      drugs that were advertised for the purpose. But these always made one ill,
      and seldom did anything else. Corydon met one young person, the wife of a
      rising stockbroker, who had presented her husband with twins in the first
      year of their marriage, and who declared that she was apparently designed
      to populate all the tenements in the city. This airy and vivacious young
      lady lay back in her automobile and prattled to Corydon, declaring that
      she was "always in trouble." She had tried to coax her family physician in
      vain, and had finally gone elsewhere. She had got quite used to the
      experience. All that troubled her nowadays was how to make excuses to her
      friends, one could not have "appendicitis" forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another side to the matter. There was one woman who had had
      a hemorrhage; and another whose sister had contracted blood-poisoning, and
      had died in agony. There were even some who pleaded and exhorted like the
      doctor, and talked about the thing's being murder. All of which arguments
      and fears Corydon brought to her husband, to be pondered and discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent whole days wandering about in the park in agony of soul. They
      had one brief month in which to decide the question&mdash;the question of
      life or death to the possible child. Truly here, once more, was an issue
      to which Thyrsis might apply the words af Carlyle&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Choose well, your choice is
    Brief and yet endless!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 6. This was also the month in which the fate of the book was
      decided. Each day, as he went for the mail, Thyrsis' heart would beat high
      with expectation; and each day he would be chilled with bitter
      disappointment. He was still hoping for a real review, or for some signs
      of the book's "catching on". Nor did he finally give up until he chanced
      to have a talk about it with his friend, Mr. Ardsley; who explained to him
      that here, too, he had fallen into a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      His "publishers" were not really publishers at all. They did not make
      their profit by selling books&mdash;they made it out of authors. There
      were many vain and foolish people who wrote books which they were anxious
      to see in print, so that they might be known as literary lights among
      their friends. Many of them had money, and would buy a number of copies;
      and the "publishers" had the expenses guaranteed in advance and so would
      make a profit upon the sale of even one or two hundred copies. All this
      being well known, the reviews never paid any attention to the
      announcements of this concern, nor did "the trade" handle their books. As
      for Thyrsis' volume, they had printed it very cheaply&mdash;it was to be
      doubted if it had cost them what he had paid them. And they had even
      published it as a "net price" book&mdash;thereby taking three cents more
      off the royalty to which he was entitled!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ardsley had declared that he would be lucky if his book sold three
      hundred copies; and so he felt that it was quite a tribute to the merits
      of his work when, after six months more of waiting, he received a royalty
      statement from the concern showing a sale of seven hundred and forty-three
      copies, and enclosing a check for eight-nine dollars and sixteen cents.
      This check Thyrsis paid over to his rich relative, and a week or two
      later, when he sold a short story, he sent the balance of the hundred
      dollars that he owed. And so he figured that the privilege of writing his
      first book and offering it to the hundred great men of letters of the
      country, had cost him the sum of one hundred and thirty-five dollars and
      eighty-four cents!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, of course, Thyrsis was hearing from these great men of letters.
      When he counted up at the end he found that he had received replies from
      sixteen of them; whether the other eighty-four received his book, or what
      they did with it, he never knew. Of these sixteen, six wrote formal
      acknowledgements, and two others said that they found nothing to appeal to
      them in his book; so there were left eight who gave him comfort, Several
      of these were among the really vital men of the time, as Thyrsis found out
      later, when he came to read their books, and to know them as something
      other than newspaper names. Several of them wrote him long and really
      helpful criticisms of his work, recognizing the merits he knew it had, and
      pointing out defects which he was quick to acknowledge. Four of them even
      told him that he had undoubted genius, and predicted great things for him.
      But that was as far as any of them went. They wrote their opinions, and
      there they stopped, as if at a blank wall. No one among them seemed to
      feel that he could take any action upon his opinion, however favorable;
      not one comprehended that what the boy was groping for was neither praise
      nor blame, but a chance for life. Not one had any advice of a practical
      sort to offer; not one had any personal or human thing to say; not one
      even asked to see him! And lest this should be due to oversight, or to
      false delicacy, Thyrsis wrote, in his desperation, and reminded them that
      the "genius" they recognized was being killed by starvation. To this, one
      did not reply, and another advised him to take up newspaper work, as "a
      means of getting in touch with the public"!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a ghastly thing to the boy as he came to realize it&mdash;this
      utter deadness and coldness of "the world". Thyrsis himself was all afire
      with love&mdash;with love, not only for his vision and his art, but for
      all humanity, and for humanity's noblest dreams. His friends were poets
      and sages of past time, men of generous faith and quick sympathies; and in
      all the world of the living, was there not one such man to be found? Was
      there nothing left upon earth but critical discernment and epistolary
      politeness?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question pursued him still more, after the one interview which
      resulted from all this correspondence. There was a distinguished Harvard
      professor who had told him that he had rare powers and must go on; and
      hearing that the professor was in New York, Thyrsis asked the privilege of
      calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of the city's most expensive hotels&mdash;for the professor
      had married a rich wife, and was what people called "socially prominent".
      The other did not know this; but it seemed an awful thing to him that
      anyone should be sitting in a brocaded silk-covered chair in a palace of
      luxury like this, while possessed of the knowledge that his genius was
      starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell me to go on, professor," he said. "But how <i>can</i> I go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor was fingering his gold eyeglasses and studying his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must get some kind of routine work," he declared&mdash;"enough to
      support you. You can't expect to live by your writing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I do that, I can't write!" cried Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to do the best you can," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't do <i>anything!</i> The emotions of it eat me all up. I
      daren't even let myself think about my work when I have to do other
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think," commented the professor, "that you would find you are
      still more hindered by the uncertainties of hack-work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do find that," the boy replied. "That is just what is the matter with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you'll be forced to a compromise in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I won't! I won't!" cried Thyrsis, wildly. "I will starve first!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or I will beg!" added Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other's look clouded slightly&mdash;as the boy, with his quick
      sensitiveness, noted instantly. "Of course," said the professor, "if you
      are not ashamed to do that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should I be ashamed? Greater men than I have begged for their
      art."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I know that. And naturally&mdash;I honor that feeling in you. If you
      have that much fervor&mdash;why, of course, you will do it. But I'm afraid
      you'll find it a humiliating experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't expect to find it a picnic," answered Thyrsis, and took his
      departure&mdash;having perceived that the professor's leading thought was
      a fear lest he should begin his begging that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there it was! There was the eminent critic, the writer of exquisite
      appreciations of literature! The darling of the salons of Boston&mdash;which
      called itself the Athens of America and the hub of the universe! A man
      with a brain full of all the culture of the ages&mdash;and with the heart
      of a mummy and the soul of a snob! He had approved of Thyrsis'
      consecration with his lips&mdash;because he did not dare to disapprove it,
      because the ghosts of a thousand paupers of genius had stood over him and
      awed him into silence. But in his secret heart he had despised this wan
      and haggard boy who threatened to beg; and the boy went out of the palace
      of luxury, feeling like an outcast rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. From this interview Thyrsis went to meet Corydon in the park; and
      after he had told her what had happened, they began one more discussion of
      their great problem. This had to be the final one; for the month of
      respite had passed, and the time for action was come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through their long arguments, Thyrsis had gradually come to realize that
      the decision rested with him. Corydon was in his hands; she had become a
      burden upon him, and she would rather she were dead; and so he had to take
      the responsibility and issue the command. So through many an hour while
      Corydon slept he had marshalled the facts and tested them, hungering with
      all his soul for knowledge of the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring a child into the world would shatter every plan they had formed.
      And yet, again and again, he forced himself to face the idea. They had
      always meant to have children ultimately; and now the gift was offered&mdash;and
      suppose they rejected it, and it should never be offered again! However
      unpropitious the hour might be, still the hour was here&mdash;the task was
      already one-third done. And if there were cares and responsibilities,
      expenses and pains of child-birth&mdash;at least they would be for a
      child; whereas, in the other case, there were also cares and
      responsibilities, expenses and pains&mdash;and for naught!
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout all this long pilgrimage of love, Thyrsis had been struck by
      the part which blind chance had played. It was blind chance that had
      brought Corydon to the country where he had gone. It was blind chance that
      he had read his book to her. And then&mdash;the chance that he had gone to
      see a doctor about diet! And that dark accident in the night, that had
      opened the gates of life to a new human soul! And now, strangest of all&mdash;the
      chance by which this last issue was to be decided! By a walk in the park,
      and a casual meeting with a nurse-maid!
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows I want to do what is right!" Thyrsis had said. "But I just
      don't know what to say!"&mdash;And then they sat down upon a bench, and
      the nurse-maid came and sat beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five or ten minutes before Thyrsis noted what was going on. He was
      lost in his sombre brooding, his eyes fixed upon vacancy; when suddenly he
      heard Corydon exclaim: "Isn't he a little love!" He turned to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse-maid was in charge of a carriage, and in the carriage was a
      baby; and the baby was smiling at Corydon, and Corydon was smiling back.
      She was poking her finger at it, and it was catching at the finger with
      its chubby paws. "Isn't he a little love!" Corydon repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis stared at her. But then, quickly, he hid his thought. He even
      pretended to be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't he pretty?" she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as a matter of fact he seemed to Thyrsis to be quite conspicuously
      ugly. He had red hair, and a flat nose, and was altogether lacking in
      aristocratic attributes. But Thyrsis answered promptly, "Yes, dear," and
      continued to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Corydon continued to play. Apparently she knew something about babies&mdash;how
      to amuse them and how to handle them, and had even heard rumors about how
      to feed them. She was asking questions of the nurse-maid, and displaying
      interest&mdash;Thyrsis would have been no more amazed had he found her in
      converse with a Chaldean astrologer. For a full quarter of an hour she had
      managed to forget her agonies of spirit, and to play with a baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      They got up to go. "You like babies, don't you, dearest?" asked Thyrsis,
      as they walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was a silence, while he pondered. Here, he perceived in a
      flash, was the great hand of Nature again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the first day of their marriage Thyrsis had been haunted by the
      sense of a dark shadow hanging over them, of a seed of tragedy in their
      love. He had his great task to do, and Corydon could not do it with him.
      The long road of his art-pilgrimage stretched out before him; and some day
      he must take his staff and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now here, of a sudden, was the solution of the problem! The answer to
      the riddle of all their disharmonies! Let Corydon have her baby&mdash;and
      then he might have his books! As he pondered, there came to him the words
      of the old doctor&mdash;"She wants that baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So before he reached home, his mind was made up. Cost what it might, she
      should have the baby. But he would not tell her his reason&mdash;that must
      be a secret between himself and Mother Nature. And then it seemed to him
      that he could hear Mother Nature laughing behind her curtain&mdash;and
      laughing not only at Corydon, but at him. He recalled with a twinge all
      his earlier cynicism, his biological bitterness; he had taken up the
      burden of his virtues again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. In many ways this decision, once arrived at, was a relief to
      them. It lifted the weight of a great fear from their lives; it gave them
      six months more of respite&mdash;and in six months, what might not Thyrsis
      be able to do? He had been toiling incessantly at his hack-work, and had
      saved nearly ninety dollars, which would be enough to keep them going
      until his new book was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book was now fairly seething in him. A wonderful thing it was to be,
      far beyond his first; in the beauty of it and the glow of it he was
      forgetting all his disappointments, all the mockeries of fate and the
      hardness of the world. If only he could get <i>this</i> book done, then
      surely he would be saved, then surely men would be forced to give him a
      chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he waited not a moment after the decision was made; he even blamed
      himself for having waited so long. From the "higher regions" there had
      come a windfall in the shape of two railroad-passes; and a couple of days
      later they stepped out upon the depot-platform of a little town upon the
      shore of Lake Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the joy of being in the country again! The smell of the newly-plowed
      earth, the sight of the spring-time verdure; and then the first glimpse of
      the lake, with its marvellous clear-green water, and the fresh cold breeze
      that blew from off it! There was challenge and adventure in that air&mdash;Thyrsis
      thought of argonauts and old sea-rovers, and his soul was stirred to high
      resolves. He took deep breaths of delight, and clenched his hands, and
      imagined that he was at his book already.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a second-hand tent which could be bought for eight dollars;
      four dollars more would pay for the lumber, and so they would live
      rent-free for the next five months! They went far down the shore of the
      lake, looking for a place to camp, and picked out a rocky headland, a mile
      from the nearest farmhouse, and completely out of sight of all the world.
      The rich woman who owned it was in Europe, but the agent gave permission;
      and then Thyrsis looked at his watch and made a wild suggestion&mdash;"Let's
      get settled this afternoon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's nearly three o'clock!" cried Corydon. "It'll be dark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be a moon," he replied, "and we can work all night if want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But suppose it should rain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see any signs of it. And what's the use of spending a night in
      the town, and wasting all that money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was decided. They went to the store and purchased their
      housekeeping equipment. What a sense of power and prosperity it gave them
      as they made their selection&mdash;two canvas-cots and two pairs of
      blankets, a lamp and an oil-can and a tiny oil-stove, two water-buckets
      and an axe and a wash-basin, a camp-stool and a hammock and a box full of
      groceries! They got a team to carry all this, in addition to their lumber
      and their trunks. They stopped at a farm-house, and arranged to get their
      milk and eggs and bread and vegetables, and also to borrow a hammer and
      saw; and then till after sundown Thyrsis toiled at the building of the
      platform and the cutting of stakes and poles for the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon fried some bacon and heated a can of corn, and they had a
      marvellous and incredible supper. Afterwards they raised the tent, and she
      held the poles erect while Thyrsis tied the guy-ropes. They had been
      advised to choose a sheltered place, back in the woods; but they were all
      for adventure and a view of the water, and so they were out on the open
      point. There were pine-trees, however, and Thyrsis had strong ropes with
      which to anchor the tent fast. When he finished, about ten o'clock at
      night, he stood off and admired the job by the light of the moon, and
      declared that a storm might tear the tent to pieces, but could never blow
      it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hauled in their trunks and the rest of their belongings, and set up
      the cots and spread the blankets. Then by the light of the oil-lamp they
      gazed about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Thyrsis," she cried, "isn't it glorious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's our home," he said. "A home we made all for ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a home without a landlady!" she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with no saloon underneath!" said he. "And no street-cars and no
      screaming children in front of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead there was the night with its thousand eyes, and the lake, with the
      moon-fire flung wide across it, and the pine-trees singing in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brr! it's cold!" exclaimed Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have to sleep with our clothes on for a while," said he. And yet
      they laughed aloud in glee. "It's all we want!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all we ever could want!" declared Corydon. "Oh, let's work hard and
      earn money enough, so that we can stay here beneath the open sky, and not
      have to go back into slavery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the morning, the joy of a plunge in the icy lake, and of a run in
      the woods, and of breakfast eaten in the warm sunlight! There was much
      work still to be done; Thyrsis had to build a stand of shelves and a table
      for the tent, and a table and a bench outside; and then all their
      belongings had to be unpacked and set in order. Such fun as they had
      laying out the imaginary partitions in their house; two bedrooms and a
      library, a kitchen and a pantry&mdash;and all outdoors for a living-room!
    </p>
    <p>
      They would count this the beginning of their love; at last they were free
      to love, and to be happy as they chose. There was no longer anyone to
      criticize them scarcely anyone to know about them; their only contact with
      the world was when they went for the mail and for provisions. They learned
      that the washer-woman who came for their clothes was ashamed for the
      poverty in which they lived, and that some of the neighbors suspected them
      of being oil-smugglers; on two occasions came sheriffs from distant
      counties to compare Thyrsis with the photographs and descriptions of
      long-sought bank-burglars and murderers. But although Thyrsis had often
      declared that he would rob a bank to secure his freedom to work, he had
      not yet done it, and so these experiences only added piquancy to their
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a life such as might have been lived in the Garden of Eden. They
      cooked and ate and studied out doors, in a sunny glade when it was cool,
      and in the shade of a great oak-tree when it was warm. They wandered about
      in the forest, they bathed naked in the crystal lake&mdash;diving from the
      rocky headland, and afterwards standing upon it and drying themselves in
      the sun. Corydon was now free to fling away the conventionalities which
      had hampered her in the city; by way of signalizing her enfranchisement
      she cut short her hair&mdash;that untamed, rebellious hair which had taken
      so long to dry and to braid and to keep in order!
    </p>
    <p>
      So they lived, in daily touch with the great heart of Nature. They saw the
      sun rise on one side of the rocky headland, and set upon the other; they
      watched the great storms sweep across the lake, and the lightnings stab
      into the water. Sometimes, at night, the gale would shake their tent until
      they could not be sure if it was wind or thunder; but the stays held fast,
      and they slept untroubled. And then the storm would pass, and in the
      morning there would be the lake, sparkling in the sunlight; and the sky,
      clear as crystal, with the white gulls wheeling about, and grey-blue
      herons standing near the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were bass to be caught from the rocky point. "So we must have at
      least one meal of fish every day," declared Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm willing," said Corydon&mdash;"if you'll catch them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then, there are lots of squirrels about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Squirrels!" cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I can knock one over with a stone now and then&mdash;you'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Thyrsis! To eat them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever taste one?" he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's cruel!" she exclaimed; and he thought to himself, How like the
      little Corydon of old!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I've skinned him and fried him in bacon grease," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even so it proved. Corydon was troubled by the crisp little toes
      turned up in the air, but when these had been cut off, she yielded to the
      allurements of odor and taste. "I'm nothing but a digesting machine
      nowadays!" she lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Thyrsis replied in the words of the village-girl in "Faust,"
      "'She feeds two when she eats!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been obliged to give up their attempt to live on prunes and
      turnips. For the doctor had warned them that Corydon must have plenty of
      "good nourishing food"; and this warning was backed up by all her women
      acquaintances&mdash;and also by Corydon's own inner voices. The appetite
      that she developed was appalling to them&mdash;not only as to quantity but
      as to quality. She would find herself unable to eat anything they had in
      their pantry, and with a craving for the wildest and most impossible
      things; or she would not know what she wanted&mdash;and would travel to
      the store and gaze about at the provisions, until a sudden illumination
      came. Sometimes she would be so hungry for it that she could not wait to
      get home, but would sit down by the road-side and devour the contents of
      the market-basket. To these cravings she yielded religiously, because she
      had been told that they represented vital needs of her system. Some one
      had told her an appalling tale about a pregnant woman who had been
      possessed by a desire for bananas; and because she had not gratified it,
      the baby when born had cried for five weeks&mdash;until they had fed it a
      banana!
    </p>
    <p>
      These strange experiences lent new interest to their intimacy. They went
      through all the journey of maternity together. Pretty soon the changes in
      her body began to be noticeable; and day by day they would watch these.
      How wonderful it all was, how incredible! Thyrsis would sink upon his
      knees before her, and clasp his arms about her and laugh "She's going to
      have a little baby!" And Corydon would blush and protest; she did not like
      to be teased about it&mdash;she was still only half reconciled to it. "I'm
      only a child myself!" she would cry. "I've no education&mdash;nothing! And
      I'm not fit for it!" Then he would have to comfort her, telling her that
      life was long, and that the child would be something to study.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the weighty question of the name which they should give the
      child. In this, as in other matters, they were without precedents and
      limitations, and they found that excess of freedom is sometimes an
      embarrassment. They were impelled towards literary reminiscence; and
      Thyrsis soon realized that this was a matter in which the sensuous
      temperament would have to have its way. "After all," argued Corydon, "to
      you a name is a name. If you can call the baby and have it answer, isn't
      that all you care about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he assented, "I suppose so; if the name's too unhandy for calling,
      I can have a nickname."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Corydon, on the other hand, a name was a vital thing; a child that was
      lovely under one name might be unendurable under another. She had been
      reading Ossian, and the poems of the neo-Celtic enthusiasts; so after much
      pondering and consultation she announced that Cedric and Eileen were the
      two names from which they would choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Many moods of tenderness came to them. He loved to fondle her, to
      exchange endearments with her. They gave each other foolish names, after
      the fashion of lovers the world over; and they would go on to modify these
      names, and add prefixes and suffixes, until the most ingenious philologist
      could not have figured out where the names had started. They made new
      words, also; they invented a whole language for use in these times of
      illumination, and which Thyrsis denoted by the name of "dam-fool talk".
    </p>
    <p>
      One was always discovering new qualities in Corydon. She had as many moods
      as the lake by which they lived, and it seemed to him that with each mood
      her whole personality changed&mdash;she would even look like another
      being. There was the every-day Corydon, demure, and rather silent; and
      then there was the Corydon who lived in the arms of Nature&mdash;who swam
      in the water, a sister of the mermaids, and made herself drunken with the
      sunlight; and then would come a mood of mischief, and laughter would break
      from her, and her wit would be such that Thyrsis would sigh for a
      stenographer. She would make herself a Grecian costume out of a sheet, and
      dance to music of her own making; or she would put trinkets upon her
      forehead, and be a gypsy-queen&mdash;she could be anything that was wild
      and exotic and unpremeditated. She had dances for that mood also&mdash;she
      would laugh and caper as merrily as any young witch. But then, again,
      there would come the Corydon of melancholy and despair; her features would
      shrink up, her face would become peaked and pitiful, she would seem like a
      child of ten. Sometimes Thyrsis could laugh her out of such a mood by
      telling her of her "beady black eyes"; and she did not like to desecrate
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now there was a new Corydon&mdash;the Corydon who had been chosen of
      the Lord, the worker of a miracle. This gave new awe to her presence, it
      set a crown upon her forehead. One morning, in mid-summer, they had come
      out from their bath, and she stood upon the rock in the sunshine; and
      suddenly he saw her give a start, and stand transfixed, staring in front
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice thrilled as she whispered, "Thyrsis! It moved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moved?" he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt the child move!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he came and put his hands upon her body, and together they stood
      waiting, breathless, as if listening for a far-off sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! There!" she cried. "Did you feel it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had felt it. And in all his life had he ever felt anything
      stranger? The first sign of the new life that was to be&mdash;the first
      hail out of the darkness of nonentity! And truly, to hear that hail was to
      be rapt into regions of wonder unspeakable!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be a new human soul; a creature like themselves, with a mind of
      its own, and a sense of responsibility&mdash;It would be a man or a woman,
      independent, self-creating, and knowing naught about this strange
      inception. And yet, it would be their life also; they had caused it&mdash;but
      for them it would never have been! Blindly, unwittingly, following the
      guidance of some power greater than themselves, they had called it into
      being. And in some mysterious and incredible way it would share their
      qualities; it would be a blending of their natures, a symbol of their
      union, of the strange fire that had blazed up in them and fused them
      together. Truly, had they not come here to the essence of love, that great
      blind force which had ruled and guided all things from Time's beginning?
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the very making of life, it seemed. And yet, they
      wondered&mdash;were they really there? This new soul that was to be&mdash;had
      they in truth created it? Or had it existed before this? And whence did it
      come? If it was really the dignified and divine thing that it would
      someday imagine itself to be, was it not uncanny that it should have come
      thus&mdash;a nameless, half-human, half-animal thing, kicking inside the
      body of a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Being, in all its ineffable mystery, its monstrous and unendurable
      strangeness. They lived face to face with it, they saw a thousand aspects
      of it. Sometimes Corydon would be obsessed with the sense of the sheer
      weight she carried; a burden fastened upon her and not to be got rid of&mdash;an
      imposition and torment to her. Then again, she would see herself in
      grotesque and even comical lights&mdash;as akin to all the animals, a
      cousin of the patient cow. And then would come a moment of sudden wonder,
      when she would be transfigured, a being divine, conferring the boon of
      life upon another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this last way that Thyrsis thought of her. There was about her a
      sense of brooding mystery, as of one who walks in the midst of
      supernatural presences. She would sit for hours gazing before her, like
      Joan of Arc listening to her voices; and he would be touched with awe, and
      would kiss her tenderly and with reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought new meanings into their love, new meanings into his life; he
      would clench his hands and vow afresh his battle with the world. How
      hideous a thing it was that at this time she should be tormented by fears
      of want and failure! That she should have to go without comforts, that she
      should even fear to ask for necessities&mdash;because she knew how fast
      his little store of money was going! Other women had children, and they
      did not have to be haunted by the doubt if it was right to have them, if
      there would be any place for them in the world. And some of these were
      selfish and idle women, too&mdash;and yet they had everything they needed!
      And here was Corydon, beautiful and noble, the very soul of devotion&mdash;Corydon
      must be harrowed and tortured! He did not really mind the world's
      treatment of himself, but for this treatment of her&mdash;ah, someday the
      world should pay for that! Someday it should do penance for its mockery
      and its blindness, that had been a blasphemy against the holy spirit
      itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      At such times as this he would put his arms about her, and try to whisper
      something of the pity and grief that filled his heart. He would try to
      tell her how much he really loved her, how utterly he was devoted to her.
      Some day she should have her rights, some day he would repay her for all
      that she had dared for him. And then the tears would come into Corydon's
      eyes, and she would answer that she feared nothing and cared about
      nothing, so long as she had his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. After these things, Thyrsis would go at his book again. He would
      go at it doggedly, desperately. He had scarcely taken time to get settled
      in the tent and to get their housekeeping régime under way, before he had
      heard the call of the book and wandered away to wrestle with it. The
      writing of it was a matter of life and death with him now&mdash;of life
      and death, not only for himself, and for Corydon, but for the unborn soul
      as well. His money would last him only six or eight weeks, and then he
      would have to take to pot-boiling again. So every hour was precious; this
      time there could be no blundering permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was not writing now about minstrels and princesses; he was not
      painting enraptured pictures of joy and love. The pain of life had become
      too real to him. His six months of contact with the world had filled him
      with bitterness; and he was forging a sharp spear, that he could drive
      into the heart of folly and stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the story of Hathawi, the dreamer, which he had come upon in a
      Hindoo legend. "The Hearer of Truth," was to be the title of the book; and
      for it Thyrsis was working out a new style. In the original it had been a
      fanciful tale; but he meant to take it over to the world of everyday
      reality, to give it the atmosphere of utter verihood. He meant to use a
      style of biblical simplicity, bare of all ornament, dealing with the most
      elemental things. And this might seem easy, but in reality it was the
      hardest thing in the world&mdash;it was like blank verse. One might toil
      all day for a single phrase into which to pack one's meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to show Hathawi from the beginning; the solitary child, the seer
      of life's mystery, who went away into a lonely place to brood. He dwelt in
      the high mountains, where the lightning played and the storm-winds shook
      him; he disciplined his will by fasting and prayer, so that the self in
      him died, and he could perceive eternal things, and aspects of being that
      are hidden. He went into the forests and dwelt with the wild things, and
      learned to understand their language&mdash;not only their beauty and their
      power, which are plain; not only their fears and their hatreds, which are
      painful to discover; but also their love, which is deepest of all. He
      learned to know the life which is in lifeless things&mdash;in water and
      air and fire; the joys and sorrows of the flowers, and the venerable
      wisdom of great trees, and the worship which is in the floods of sunlight.
      And having learned these things, Hathawi came back into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that he was able to read the souls of men, but at first he could
      not believe what he read&mdash;it was so terrible, and so far from nature.
      He preferred to stay among the poor, because they were closer to the heart
      of things, and their falsehoods were simple. But he discovered that the
      evil and misery of men's life came from above, and so he went into the
      "great world" to dwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everywhere he went, men's innermost thoughts were revealed to him, and
      to themselves through him. He acted upon men and women like wine&mdash;an
      impulse seized them to speak the truth, the truth that they had hidden
      even from their own hearts. Afterwards, when they realized what they had
      done, they hated Hathawi and feared him; but they said nothing, because
      each thought that the secret was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, as his power grew, Hathawi began to reveal men in more public
      ways, and a scandal arose. There was whispered a story of a great
      statesman who had declared at a banquet what was his real work in the
      world; and one day a bishop arose in his cathedral and said that he taught
      the dogmas of his church, because they were necessary to keep the people
      in subjection. Then came the famous episode of a policeman who bade the
      prisoner go free and arrested the judge instead. Other policemen were
      called upon to hinder their comrade, but they declared that he was right;
      and then newspaper reporters, when ordered to write about it, avowed that
      they would write only what they believed. After which came a convention of
      one of the great political parties; and the presidential candidate made a
      speech, outlining his actual beliefs, and so destroyed his party. This, of
      course, was a national calamity, for all statesmen declared that the
      people could not be deceived by one party; and then, too, it was reported
      that Hathawi meant to attend the convention of the other party!
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this they shut him up in jail, charging him with being a
      vagrant, which he undoubtedly was. But he won over all the jailers and the
      prisoners to his doctrine, and so the jail was emptied. Moreover, it was
      found that some of those who loved him most truly had come to share his
      power of hearing truth. The madness was spreading everywhere; agitators
      were busy among the people, and public safety was threatened. So a certain
      very rich man, who in Hathawi's presence had vowed himself a wolf, engaged
      an assassin to strike him down in broad daylight upon the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in order to suppress the disturbance, they spirited the body away and
      burned it, and scattered the ashes. But this was a bad thing for them to
      do, for the ashes became seeds of the new contagion, and all through the
      great city, in the strangest and most unaccountable way, men would
      suddenly begin to speak the truth. And, of course this made business
      impossible&mdash;the merchants and traders had to move away; and how was
      it possible to preserve authority, when sooner or later all the lawyers
      and the judges and the politicians would speak truth? So the people arose
      and declared that they were weary of lies, and they erected a statue of
      Hathawi at one of the places where his ashes had fallen, and declared that
      every candidate for office must make his speeches there. After that it was
      a long time before there were any officials elected&mdash;because no man
      could be found to whom prominence and power were not more precious than
      public welfare. But meanwhile the people thrived exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, however&mdash;the climax of the story&mdash;the news of all this
      had spread to other nations, and the rulers of these nations perceived
      that it was anarchy, and could by no means be permitted&mdash;their own
      people were threatening to rise. It must be clearly shown that a state
      without a government would be plundered by enemies; and so they prepared
      to plunder it. And so arose a great agitation in Hathawi's home-state, and
      men called for a dictator, and for preparations of defence. But the
      followers of Hathawi cried out, saying, "Let us submit! Let us open our
      city to these men, and let them do their will&mdash;for the power of the
      truth is greater than even they." And so it was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hostile rulers heard of this a great fear took possession of
      them. They remembered the fate of certain famous diplomatists they had
      already sent over; and they dared not trust themselves near the statue of
      the Hearer of Truth. So their plans of invasion came to naught; and among
      their own people there was laughter and bitter mockery; and behold, one
      morning, a statue of Hathawi which some one had set up in a public-square!
      Here the lovers of truth gathered by thousands, and the soldiers who were
      sent to shoot them laid down their arms and joined them; and so, all over
      the world, was the end of the dominion of the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. Such was the outline of Thyrsis' story. He judged that it might
      be a very great story, or a comparatively commonplace one&mdash;it all
      depended upon the power with which it was visioned. He must get into
      himself and wrestle the thing out. This was to be his act of creation&mdash;his
      baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time since his marriage that Thyrsis had tried really to
      do what he called work. All things else had been mere echoes of the work
      he had done the previous summer; but now he had to do something new,
      something that was an echo of nothing else. Every day that he faced the
      task, his agony and despair of soul grew greater; for he found that he <i>could</i>
      not do the work. He could not even begin to do it&mdash;he could not even
      try to do it! He was helpless, bound hand and foot!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not his fault, it was not Corydon's fault; it was a tragedy
      inherent in the very nature of things&mdash;in the two natures that were
      in himself. There was the man, who loved a woman, and hungered to see her
      happy; and there was the artist, to whom solitude was the very breath of
      life. To write this book&mdash;to write it really&mdash;he would have to
      spend weeks of brooding over it, thinking about nothing else day and
      night; he would have to shape his whole existence to that end to be free
      from every distracting circumstance, from everything that called him out
      of himself. And how could he hope for such a thing, while he was living in
      a tent with another person?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had his artist's standard of perfection. Of course, he could never
      actually be satisfied with what he did; but at least he could feel that it
      was the best he was equal to&mdash;he could get a real and honest sense of
      exhaustion for himself. But now, the moment that he faced the problem
      fairly, he saw he could never get that real and honest sense of exhaustion
      again. He was dragged up to the issue and forced to face it instantly. The
      pressure of circumstances upon him was overwhelming; and he had to make up
      his mind to do something he had never done before&mdash;instead of really
      writing his books, to do the best he could with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, inevitable as this was, and clearly as he saw it, he could not make
      up his mind to it. In reality, he never did make up his mind to it. He did
      it, and in his inmost heart he knew that he was doing it; but all the time
      he was trying to deny it, was wrestling with agony and despair in his soul
      in the effort to do something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would go away in the morning and try to think about the book; and just
      when he would get started, it would be time for dinner, and there would be
      the image of Corydon waiting for him. And so he would go home, and go back
      in the afternoon&mdash;and when he had got started again, it would be
      dark. The next day, having explained his trouble, he would take his lunch
      away with him; but in the forenoon there would come a drenching
      thunder-storm, and he would have to go back again. Or he would try to work
      in the tent at night; and the wind would howl and blow the lamp so that he
      could not put his mind on anything. Nor did it avail him to rail at
      himself, to tell himself that he was a fool for being at the mercy of such
      mishaps. It was none the less a fact that he was at the mercy of them, and
      that he could no longer give himself up to the sway of his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      And always there was Corydon, yearning for his companionship. It had
      always been their idea that they should do the work together; so
      completely would they be fused in the fire of love, that she would share
      his soul states and write parts of his books. But now that idea had to be
      abandoned; and this was <i>her</i> tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to sit and think of my health!" she would exclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't your health, dear," he would plead; "it's the health of the
      child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that. But then, am I always to sit at home and be placid, while
      you go away to wrestle with the angels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always, Corydon," he said. "This will pass&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I do," she cried, "I only stay to wrestle with the demons. And is that
      so very good for a pregnant woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear!" he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just as I said!" she went on. "I ought not to have had the child!
      I'm only a school-girl, with a school-girl's tasks. And I try and try, but
      I can't help it&mdash;everything within me rebels at the cares of
      mother-hood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one mood, dear," he said. "But you know that's not true always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all the clearer to me," she insisted, "since we've had to give up
      our music. I can't work at the piano any more&mdash;I may never be able
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But even if you could, Corydon, I couldn't afford to get you one now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, of course not. And you have to give up your violin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much time I have to practice it in our present plight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;I know! But don't you see, we lose our last hope of growing
      together? I've a vision that haunts me all the time&mdash;you going away
      to do your work, and staying for longer and longer periods&mdash;and I
      sitting at home to mind the baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day he would come back, and she would ask him how the book was
      going; and he would have to answer that it was not going at all. Then, in
      his desperation, he would make up his mind to write what he could&mdash;to
      be content with this glimpse of one scene, and with that feeble echo of
      what he knew the next scene ought to be; and he would bring the result to
      Corydon, and would discover with a secret pang that she did not know the
      difference. But then he would ask himself&mdash;how could she know the
      difference? The difference did not exist! His vision of the thing had
      existed in himself, and in himself alone; if he never uttered it, the
      world would never know what it might have been&mdash;and would never care.
      Ah, what a future was that to look forward to&mdash;to filling the ears of
      the world with lamentations concerning the books that he might have
      written! And all the time knowing that the ears of the world were deaf to
      every sound he made!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. He thought that he realized the bitterness of this tragedy all
      at once; but the real bitterness was that he had to realize more and more
      of it every day. It was a tragedy he had to live in the house with. He had
      to watch it working itself out in all the little affairs of life; he had
      to see it manifesting itself in his own soul, and in the soul of Corydon,
      and even in the soul of the child. Worst of all to him, the artist, he had
      to see it working itself out in what he wrote&mdash;in book after book
      that went out to represent him to the world, and that did not represent
      him at all, but only represented the Snare in which he had been caught! It
      was one of the facts about this Snare, that there was no merciful Keeper
      to come and put the victim out of his misery with a blow upon the head;
      that he was left alone, to writhe and twist and tear himself to pieces,
      and to perish of slow exhaustion. It was not a murder&mdash;it was a
      crucifixion!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not have told for whom his heart bled most, for himself, or for
      Corydon. Here she was, with her grim problems and her bitter necessities;
      needing advice and comfort, needing companionship&mdash;needing a husband!
      And she had married an artist&mdash;a reed that would grow "nevermore
      again as a reed with the reeds by the river!" That could not grow, even if
      it had wanted to! For it was quite in vain that the world cried out to him
      to settle down and become as other men; he could not. The thing that was
      tearing at his vitals would continue to tear; the only choice he had was
      between self-expression and madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, wrung as his heart was, he had to go away and as he could. If he
      yielded to his desire and stayed by her, then the book would not be
      written in time; and so all their hopes would be gone&mdash;they would
      never win their freedom then! And he would explain this to her; with their
      relentless devotion to the truth, they would talk it all out between them.
      They would trace every cord and knot of the Snare. And Corydon would grant
      that he was right, and that she must submit. He must stay away all day&mdash;and
      all night, if need be&mdash;till the book was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that they were always able to settle their problems in the cold light
      of reason. Sometimes Thyrsis, with his artist's ups and downs, would be
      nervous and irritable; he would manifest impatience over trifles, and this
      would give rise to tragedies. There was a vast amount of fetching and
      emptying of water to be done for their little establishment; and sometimes
      a man who was carrying the destinies of the human race in his
      consciousness was not as prompt as he might have been in attending to
      these humble tasks. And moreover, the water all had to be dipped up from
      the lake; and sometimes, when it was stormy, it was a difficult matter to
      get it as free from specks as was needed for the ablutions of a fastidious
      young lady like Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd only take a little trouble!" she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble!" he would exclaim. "Do you think I enjoy hearing you complain
      about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis, this is dirtier than ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it. The wind is blowing harder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you'd only reach out a little ways&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reached out till I nearly fell into the water!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis, how can I ever wash my face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it would go. Thyrsis would be absorbed in some especially important
      mental operation, and it would be a torment to him to have such things
      forced upon his attention. Corydon, it seemed to him, was always at the
      mercy of externals; and she was forever dragging him out of himself, and
      making him aware of them. The frying-pan was not clean enough, or his hair
      was unkempt; his trousers were ragged or his coat was too small for him.
      Was life always to consist of such impertinences as this?
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Thyrsis, in a sudden burst of rage, gave the water-bucket a kick
      which sent it rolling down the bank, and then strode away to his work. But
      unfortunately his work was not of a sort which he could do with angry
      emotions in his soul. And so very soon remorse overcame him. He returned,
      to find that Corydon had rushed out to the end of the point, and flung
      herself down upon the rocks in hysterics. And this, of course, was not a
      good thing for a pregnant woman, and so he had to set to work to soothe
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, to soothe her was never an easy task, because of her
      sensitiveness, and her exalted ideals of him. However humbly he might
      apologize and beg forgiveness, there would remain her grief that it had
      been possible for a quarrel to occur between them. She would drive him
      nearly wild by debating the event, and rehearsing it again and again,
      trying to justify herself to him, and him to himself. Thyrsis was robust,
      he wanted to let the past take care of itself; he would tell her of all
      the worries that were harassing him, and would plead with her to grant him
      the privilege of any ordinary human creature, to manifest annoyance now
      and then. And Corydon would promise it&mdash;she would promise him
      anything he asked for; but this was a boon it did not lie within the
      possibility of her temperament to grant. He could be angry at fate and at
      the world, and could rage and storm at them all he pleased; but he could
      never be harsh with Corydon without inflicting upon her pain that wrecked
      her, and wrecked him into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, he thought, it was her condition that accounted for this
      morbidness. She was liable to fits of depression, and to mysterious
      illness&mdash;nausea and faintness and what not. Also, she had been told
      weird tales about prenatal influences; and he, not having been educated in
      such matters, could not be sure what were the facts. So, whenever she had
      been unhappy, there was the possibility that she had done some irreparable
      harm to the child! And that made more problems for an over-worked and
      sensitive artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon saw that he had to suppress forever the side of him that was stern
      and exacting. Such things had a place in his own life, but no longer in
      Corydon's. Instead, he would see how she suffered, and his heart would be
      wrung, and he would come back again and again to comfort her, and to tell
      her how he loved her, how he longed to do what was right. He would set
      before her the logic of the situation, so that if things went wrong she
      might realize that it was neither his fault nor hers&mdash;that it was the
      world, which kept them in this misery, and shut them up to suffer
      together. So it was, all through their lives, that their remorseless
      reason saved them; they would find in the analysis and exposition of the
      causes of their own unhappiness the one common satisfaction they had in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13. These were the circumstances of the writing of "The Hearer of
      Truth". It was completed in six weeks, and it did not satisfy its author,
      the finishing of it brought him no joy. But that, though he did not
      realize it, was the one circumstance in its favor&mdash;the less it
      satisfied him, the more chance there was that the world would know what it
      was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the manuscript copied, and then he sent it off to a magazine in
      Boston, whose editor had been one of his hundred great men, and had
      promised to read the new manuscript at once. Meantime Thyrsis sent for
      some books to review, and got to work at another plot to be submitted to
      the editor of the "Treasure Chest". For their own treasure-chest was now
      all but empty, and one could not live forever upon blueberries and fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day they waited; and at last, one fateful afternoon, the farmer
      came with some provisions and their mail. There was a letter from Boston,
      and Thyrsis opened it and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read your manuscript, 'The Hearer of Truth', and I wish to tell
      you of the very great pleasure it has given me. It is noble and fine, and
      amazingly clever as well. I must say frankly that I was astonished at the
      qualities of maturity and restraint it shows. I think it quite certain
      that we shall wish to use it as a serial; but before I can say anything
      definite, the manuscript will have to be read by my associates. In the
      meantime I wished to tell you personally how highly I think of your work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read this, and then, without a word, he passed it on to Corydon.
      As soon as the farmer's back was turned, the two fell into each other's
      arms, and all but wept. It was victory, beyond all question. The magazine
      might pay as much as five hundred dollars for the serial rights&mdash;and
      with that start, they would surely be safe. Besides that, it would mean
      recognition for Thyrsis&mdash;the world would have to discuss his work!
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing pot-boilers was easy after such a triumph as that. They even treated
      themselves to holidays&mdash;they purchased a quart of ice-cream on one
      day, and hired a boat and went picnicking on another. Thyrsis got out his
      fiddle once again, and even became so reckless as to inquire about the
      price of a "practice-clavier" for Corydon. Also he began inquiring as to
      the cost of houses; when they got the money they would build themselves a
      little cabin here&mdash;a cabin just the size of the tent, but with a room
      upstairs where Thyrsis could do his work. After that they would be free
      from all the world&mdash;they would never go back to be haunted by the
      sight of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Sorrow barricadoed evermore
    Within the walls of cities."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 14. So a month passed by; and Thyrsis wrote again to the editor, and
      was told that they were still discussing the story. And then, after two
      more weeks, there came another letter; and this was the way it read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to have to tell you that the decision has been adverse to
      using your story. My own opinion of it has not changed in the least; but I
      have been unable to induce my associates to view it in the same light.
      They seem to be unanimous in the opinion that your work is too radical for
      us to put to the front. We have a very conservative, fastidious, and
      sophisticated constituency; and this is one of the limitations by which we
      are bound. I am more than sorry that things have turned out so, and I
      trust I need hardly say that I shall be glad to read anything else that
      you may have to submit to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      And there it was! "A conservative, fastidious, and sophisticated
      constituency!" Thyrsis believed that he would never forget that phrase
      while he lived. Could one get up a thing like that anywhere in the world
      save in Boston?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bitter and cruel disappointment&mdash;the more so because it had
      taken six weeks of his precious time. But there was nothing to be done
      about it save to send off the manuscript to another magazine. And when it
      had come back from there he sent it to another, and to yet another&mdash;paying
      each time a total of eighty cents to the express-company, a sum which was
      very hard for him to spare. To make an ending at once to the painful
      episode, he continued to send it from one place to another, until "The
      Hearer of Truth" had had the honor of being declined by a total of fifteen
      magazines and twenty-two publishing-houses. The pilgrimage occupied a
      period of nineteen months&mdash;after which, to Thyrsis' great surprise,
      the thirty-eighth concern offered to publish it. And so the book was
      brought out, with something of a flourish, and met with its thirty-eighth
      rejection&mdash;at the hands of the public!

      BOOK VII. THE CAPTURE IS COMPLETED
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The shadow of a dark cloud had fallen upon the woods, and the voices of
      the birds were strangely hushed. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a spell about this place for me," she said, and quoted&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Here came I often, often in old days&mdash;
    Thyrsis and I, we still had Thyrsis then!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Where is Thyrsis now?" she asked; and he smiled sadly, and responded:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Ah me! this many a year
    My pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday!
    Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart
    Into the world and wave of men depart!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. They returned to the city early in October&mdash;not so much
      because they minded the cold in the tent, as because their money was gone,
      and it was not easy to do hack-work at a distance. One had to be on the
      spot, to interview the editors, to study their whims and keep one's self
      in their minds; otherwise some one else got the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis came back to his "world"; and he found this world up in arms
      against him. All the opposition that he had ever had to face was nothing
      to what he faced now. Society seemed to have made up its collective mind
      that he should give in; and every force it could use was brought to bear
      upon him&mdash;every person he knew joined in the assault upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bound to admit that they had all the arguments on their side. He
      had gone his own obstinate way, in defiance of all advice and of all
      precedent; and now he saw what had come of it&mdash;exactly what every
      common-sense person had foreseen. He and Corydon had tried their "living
      as brother and sister"&mdash;and here she was with child! And that was all
      right, no one proposed to blame him for it; it was what people had
      predicted, and they were rather pleased to have their predictions come
      true&mdash;to see the bubble of his pretenses burst, and to be able to
      point out to him that he was like all other men. What they wanted now was
      simply that he should recognize his responsibility, and look out for
      Corydon's welfare. Living in tenement-rooms and in tents, like gypsies and
      savages, was all right by way of a lark; it was all very picturesque and
      romantic in a novel; but it would not do for a woman who was about to
      become a mother. Corydon had been delicately reared. She was used to the
      comforts and decencies of life; and to get her in her present plight and
      then not provide these things for her would be the act of a scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through his life the world had had but one message for Thyrsis: "Go to
      work!" From the world's point of view his languages and literatures, his
      music and writing were all play; to "work" was to get a "position". And
      now this word was dinned into his ears day and night, the very stones in
      the street seemed to cry it at him&mdash;"Get a position! Get a position!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As chance would have it, the position was all ready. In the higher regions
      they were preparing to open a branch of a great family establishment
      abroad, and Thyrsis was invited to take charge of it. He would be paid
      three thousand dollars a year at the start, and two or three times as much
      ultimately; and what more could he want? He knew nothing about the work,
      but they knew his abilities&mdash;that if he would undertake it, and give
      his attention to it, he would succeed. He would meet people of culture,
      they argued, and be broadened by contact with men; as for Corydon, it
      would make her whole life over. Surely, for her sake, he could not refuse!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had foreseen just such things. He had braced himself to meet the
      shock, and the world found him with his hands clenched and his jaws set.
      There was no use in arguing with him, he had but one answer&mdash;"No! No!
      No!" He would not take that position, and he would not take any other
      position&mdash;neither now, nor at any future time. He was not a
      business-man, he was an artist; and an artist he would remain to the end.
      It might as well be understood at the outset; there was nothing that the
      world could do or say to him that would move him one inch. They might
      starve him, they might kill him, they might do what they could or would&mdash;but
      never would he give in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;what are you going to do?" they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, "I am going to write my books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have already written two books, and nothing has come of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something may come of them yet," he said. "And if it doesn't, I shall
      simply go on and write another, and another, and another. I shall continue
      to write so long as I have the strength left in me; I shall be trying to
      write when I die."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, while they argued and pleaded and scolded and wept, he stood in
      silence. They could not understand him&mdash;he smiled bitterly as he
      realized how impossible it was for them to understand even the simplest
      thing about him. There was the dapper corporation lawyer and his exquisite
      young wife, who came to argue about it; and Thyrsis asked them not to tell
      Corydon why they had come. He saw them look at each other significantly,
      and he could read their thought&mdash;that he was afraid of his wife's
      importunities. And how could he explain to them what he had really meant&mdash;that
      if they had told Corydon they had come to persuade him to give up his art,
      Corydon would probably have found it impossible to be even decently polite
      to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. So Thyrsis went away, carrying the burden of the scorn and
      contempt of every human soul he knew. It was in truth a dark hour in his
      life. He was at his wit's end for the bare necessities. He had reached the
      city with less money in his pocket than he had had the year before; and
      all the ways by which he had got money seemed to have failed him at once.
      All the editors who published book-reviews seemed to have a stock on hand;
      or else to know of people whose style of writing pleased their readers
      better. And none of them seemed to fancy any ideas for articles that
      Thyrsis had to suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worst of all, the editor of the '"Treasure Chest" turned down the
      pot-boiler which he had been writing up in the country. He would not say
      anything very definite about it&mdash;he just didn't like the story&mdash;it
      had not come up to the promise of the scenario. He hinted that perhaps
      Thyrsis was not as much interested in his work as he had been before. It
      seemed to be lacking in vitality, and the style was not so good. Thyrsis
      offered to rewrite parts of the story; but no, said the editor, he did not
      care for the story at all. He would be willing to have Thyrsis try
      another, but he was pretty well supplied with serials just then, and could
      not give much encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon had yielded to her parents and gone to stay with them for a while;
      and Thyrsis had got his own expenses down to less than five dollars a week&mdash;including
      such items as stationery and postage on his manuscripts. And still, he
      could not get this five dollars. In his desperation he followed the cheap
      food idea to extremes, and there were times when an invitation to an
      honest meal was something he looked forward to for a week. And day after
      day he wandered about the streets, racking his brains for new ideas, for
      new plans to try, for new hopes of deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later years he looked back upon it all&mdash;knowing then the depth of
      the pit into which he had fallen, knowing the full power of the forces
      that were ranged against him&mdash;and he marvelled that he had ever had
      the courage to hold out. But in truth the idea of surrender did not occur
      to him; the possibility of it did not lie in his character. He had his
      message to deliver. That was what he was in the world for, and for nothing
      else; and he must deliver what he could of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would go alone, and his vision would come to him. It would come to him,
      radiant, marvellous, overwhelming; there had never been anything like it
      in the world, there might never be anything like it in the world again.
      And if only he could get the world to realize it&mdash;if only he could
      force some hint of it into the mind of one living person! It was
      impossible not to think that some day that person would be discovered&mdash;to
      believe otherwise would be to give the whole world up for damned. He would
      imagine that chance person reading his first book; he would imagine the
      publishers and their advisers reading "The Hearer of Truth"&mdash;might it
      not be that at this very hour some living soul was in the act of finding
      him out? At any rate, all that he could do was to try, and to keep on
      trying; to embody his vision in just as many forms as possible, and to
      scatter them just as widely as possible. It was like shooting arrows into
      the air; but he would go on to shoot while there was one arrow left in his
      quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Thyrsis reasoned the problem out for himself; he saw what he
      wanted, and that it was a rational and honest thing for him to want. He
      was a creative artist, engaged in learning his trade. When he had
      completed his training, he would not work for himself, he would work to
      bring joy and faith to millions of human beings, perhaps for ages after.
      And meantime, while he was in the practice-stage, he asked for the bare
      necessities of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it as if he were an utter tyro; he had given proof of his power.
      He had written two books, which some of the best critics in the country
      had praised. To this people made answer that it was no one's business to
      look out for genius and give it a chance to live. But with Thyrsis it was
      never any argument to show that a thing did not exist, if it was a thing
      which he knew <i>ought</i> to exist. He looked back over the history of
      art, and saw the old hideous state of affairs&mdash;saw genius perishing
      of starvation and misery, and men erecting monuments to it when it was
      dead. He saw empty-headed rich people paying fortunes for the manuscripts
      of poems which all the world had once rejected; he saw the seven towns
      contending for Homer dead, through which the living Homer begged his
      bread. And Thyrsis could not bring himself to believe that a thing so
      monstrous could continue to exist forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no other department of human activity of which it was true. If a
      man wanted to be a preacher, he would find that people had set up
      divinity-schools and established scholarships for which he could contend.
      And the same was true if he wished to be an engineer, or an architect, or
      a historian, or a biologist; it was only the creative artist of whom no
      one had a thought&mdash;the creative artist, who needed it most of all!
      For his was the most exacting work, his was the longest and severest
      apprenticeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brooding over this, Thyrsis hit upon another plan. He drew up a letter, in
      which he set forth what he wanted, and stated what he had so far done; he
      quoted the opinions of his work that had been written by men-of-letters,
      and offered to submit the books and manuscripts about which these opinions
      had been written. He sent a copy of this letter to the president of each
      of the leading universities in the country, to find out if there was in a
      single one of them any fellowship or scholarship or prize of any sort,
      which could be won by such creative literary work. Of those who replied to
      him, many admitted that his point was well taken, that there should have
      been such provision; but one and all they agreed that none existed. There
      were rewards for studying the work of the past, but never for producing
      new work, no matter how good it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then another plan occurred to him. He wrote an anonymous article, setting
      forth some of his amusing experiences, and contrasting the credit side of
      the "pot-boiling" ledger with the debit side of the "real art" ledger.
      This article was picturesque, and a magazine published it, paying
      twenty-five dollars for it, and so giving him another month's lease of
      life. But that was all that came of it&mdash;there was no rich man who
      wrote to the magazine to ask who this tormented genius might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyrsis, in his desperation, joined the ranks of the begging
      letter-writers. He would send long accounts of his plight to eminent
      philanthropists&mdash;having no idea that the secretaries of eminent
      philanthropists throw out basketsful of such letters every day. He would
      read in the papers of some public-spirited enterprise&mdash;he would hear
      of this man or that woman who was famous for his or her interest in
      helpful things&mdash;and he would sit down and write these people that he
      was starving, and implore them to read his book. In later years, when he
      came to know of some of these newspaper idols, it was a comfort to him to
      feel certain that his letters had been thrown away unread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also he begged from everybody he met, under whatever circumstances he met
      them. If by any chance the person might be imagined to possess money,
      sooner or later would come some hour of distress, when Thyrsis would be
      driven to try to borrow. On one occasion he counted it up, and there were
      forty-three individuals to whom he had made himself a nuisance. With half
      a dozen of them he had actually succeeded; but always promising to return
      the money when his next check came in&mdash;and always scrupulously doing
      this. There was never anyone who rose to the understanding of what he
      really wanted&mdash;a free gift, for the sake of his art. There was never
      anyone who could understand his utter shamelessness about it; that fervor
      of consecration which made it impossible for a man to humiliate him, or to
      insult him&mdash;to do anything save to write himself down a dead soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were quite clear in their views upon this question; a man must earn
      his own way in the world. And that was all right, if a man were in the
      world for himself. But what if he were working for humanity, and had no
      time to think about himself? Was that truly a disgraceful thing? Take
      Jesus, for instance; ought he to have kept at his carpenter's trade,
      instead of preaching the Sermon on the Mount? Or was it that his right to
      preach the Sermon was determined by the size of the collection he could
      take among the audience?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, while he pondered this problem of "earning one's own way,"
      Thyrsis was noting the lives of the people who were preaching it. What
      were <i>they</i> doing to earn the luxuries they enjoyed? Even granting
      that one recognized their futile benevolence as justifying them personally&mdash;what
      about the tens of thousands of others who lived in utter idleness,
      squandering in self-indulgence and ostentation huge fortunes of which they
      had never earned a penny? The boy could not go upon the streets of the
      city without having this monstrous fact flaunted in his face in a thousand
      forms. So many millions for folly and vice, and not one cent for his art!
      This was the thing upon which he was brooding day and night&mdash;and
      filling his soul with an awful bitterness which was to horrify the world
      in later years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. He might not come to see Corydon in her home; but she would meet
      him in the street, and they would walk in the park, a pitiful and mournful
      pair. They had to walk slowly, and often he would have to help her, for
      her burden had now become great. She had altered all her dresses, and she
      wore a long cape, and even then was not able to hide the disfigurement of
      her person. They would sit upon a bench in the cold, and talk about the
      latest aspects of his struggle, what he was doing and what he hoped to do.
      Corydon would bring him the opinions of a few more members of the
      bourgeois world, and they would curse this world and these people
      together. For there was no more thought of giving up on Corydon's side
      than there was on his; it was not for nothing that he had talked to her
      upon the hill-top in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, however, time was passing, and the prospect of her approaching
      confinement hung over them like a black thunder-cloud. It came on
      remorselessly, menacingly. The event was due about Christmas time, and
      there must be some money then&mdash;there must be some money then! But
      where was it to be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had tried another story for the "Treasure Chest," but the editor
      had not liked his plot. Also he was taking "The Hearer of Truth" from one
      place to another; but with less and less hope, as he learned from various
      editors and publishers how radical and subversive they considered it. He
      took it now mechanically, as a matter of form&mdash;making it his rule
      always to count upon rejection, so that he might never be disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Corydon's rich friends had told her of a certain famous surgeon,
      and Corydon had gone to see him. He had a beautiful private hospital, and
      his prices were unthinkable; but he had seemed to be interested in her,
      and when she told him her circumstances, he had said that he would try to
      "meet her halfway." But even with the reductions he quoted, it would cost
      them nearly a hundred and fifty dollars; and how could Thyrsis get such a
      sum? Even if the surgeon were willing to wait&mdash;what prospect was
      there that he could ever get it?
    </p>
    <p>
      This again was the curse of their leisure-class upbringing. They did not
      know how poor women had their babies, and they shrunk from the thought of
      finding it out. Corydon had met this man, and had been impressed by him;
      and Thyrsis realized, even if she did not, that she had got her heart set
      upon the plan. And if he did not make it possible, and then anything were
      to go wrong with her, how would he ever be able to forgive himself? This
      event would come but once, and might mean so much to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he said to himself that he would "raise the money". But the days passed
      and became weeks, and the weeks became months, and there was no sign of
      the raising. And then suddenly came one of those shafts of sunlight
      through the clouds&mdash;one of those will-o'-the-wisps that were forever
      luring Thyrsis into the swamps. Another editor liked "The Hearer of
      Truth"; another editor said that it was a great piece of literature, and
      that he would surely use it! So Thyrsis went to the great surgeon and told
      him that he would be able to pay him in a little while; and the
      arrangement was made for Corydon to come. And then the editor put the
      "great piece of literature" away in his desk, and forgot all about it for
      a month&mdash;while Thyrsis waited, day by day, in an agony of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointed time had come&mdash;the day when Corydon must go to the
      hospital; and still the editor had not reported, and there was only
      fifteen or twenty dollars, earned by weeks of verse-writing and reviewing.
      So in desperation Thyrsis made up his mind to give up his violin. He had
      paid ninety dollars for it three years before; and now, after taking it
      round among the dealers, he sold it for thirty-five dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to the very gateway of life itself, Thyrsis was hounded by these
      spectres of want; even to the hospital they came, and followed him inside.
      Here was a beautiful place, a revelation to him of the possibilities of
      civilization and science. But it was all for the rich and prosperous, it
      was not for him; he felt that he had no business to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast it all made with the tenement-room in which he had to
      house! Here were glimpses to be had of rich women, soft-skinned and fair,
      clad in morning-gowns of gorgeous hue; here were baskets of expensive
      fruits and armfuls of sweet-scented flowers; and here was he with his worn
      clothing and his haggard face, his hungry stomach and still hungrier
      heart! Must not all these people know that he had had to ask for special
      rates, and then for credit on top of that? Must they not all know that he
      was a failure&mdash;that most worthless of all worthless creatures, the
      man who cannot support his family? What did it mean to them if he had
      written masterpieces of literature&mdash;what would it avail with them
      that he was the bearer of a new religion! Thyrsis had heard too much of
      the world's opinion of him; he shrunk from contact with his
      fellow-creatures, reading an insult into every glance. He was like a dog
      that has been too much beaten, and cringes even before it is struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. But these thoughts were for himself; he did not whisper them to
      Corydon. However people might despise him, they did not blame her, and
      there was no need of this bitterness in her cup. Corydon was beautiful&mdash;ah
      God, how beautiful she looked, lying there in the snowy bed, with the
      snowy lace about her neck and arms! How like the very goddess of
      motherhood she looked, a halo of light about her forehead. She, too, must
      have flowers, to whisper to her of hope and joy; and so he had brought her
      three pitiful little pinks, which he had purchased from a lame girl upon
      the corner. The tears started into Corydon's eyes as she saw these&mdash;for
      she knew that he had gone without a part of his dinner in order to bring
      them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody had come to love her already, he could see. How gentle and kind
      they were to her; and how skillfully they did everything for her! His
      heart was full of thankfulness that he had been able to bring her to this
      haven of refuge. And resolutely he put aside all thoughts of his own
      humiliation&mdash;he swept his mind clear of everything else, and went
      with her to face this new and supreme experience of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will stay with me?" she had pleaded; and he had promised that he
      would stay. She could not bear to have him out of her sight at all, and so
      they made him a bed upon the couch, and he spent the night there; and
      through the next day he sat with her and read to her. But now and then he
      would know that her thoughts had wandered, and he would look at her and
      see her eyes wide with fear. "Oh, Thyrsis," she would whisper, "I'm only a
      child; and I'm not fit to be a mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would try to comfort her and soothe her. But in truth, he too was full
      of fears and anxieties. He had felt the dome-like shape within her
      abdomen, which they said was the head of the child; and he could not
      conceive how it was ever to be got out. But they told him that the thing
      had happened before. There was nothing for either of them to do but to
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the hands of Nature, who had brought them thus far, who had
      had her will with them so utterly. And now her purpose was to be revealed
      to them&mdash;now they were to know the wherefore of all that they had
      done. They were like two children, travelling through a dark valley; they
      walked hand in hand, lifting their eyes to the mountain-tops, and seeking
      the first signs of the coming light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. Outside, whenever they opened the window, they could hear the
      noise of the busy city; and it seemed so strange that street-cars should
      jangle on, and news-boys shout, and tired men hurry home to their dinners&mdash;while
      such a thing as this was preparing. Thyrsis gave utterance to the thought;
      and the doctor, who was in the room, smiled and responded, "It happens
      twice every second in the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the house-physician, who was to take charge of the case; a young
      man, handsome and rather dapper. He went about his work with an air of its
      being an old story to him&mdash;an air which was at once reassuring and
      disturbing. The two sat and watched him, while he made his preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two white-gowned nurses with him, and he spoke to them for the most
      part in nods. One of them was elderly and grey-haired, and apparently his
      main reliance; the other was young and pretty, and her heart went out to
      Corydon. She sat by the bedside and confided to her that she was a pupil,
      and that this was only her third "case".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it hurt me much?" the girl asked, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly, before there was time for an answer, she turned white,
      and clutched Thyrsis' hand with a low cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers closed upon his convulsively, and she started up, crying
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was standing by the window, opening a case of instruments. He
      did not even turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor!" Thyrsis cried, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the case down and came toward the bed. "I guess there is nothing
      wrong," he said, with a slight smile. He laid his hand upon the shuddering
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all right," he said, "I shall examine her in a few moments."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, while Thyrsis and the young nurse held Corydon's hand and
      whispered to her soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back and lay tossing from side to side, moaning; and meantime the
      doctor went quietly on, arranging his basins and bottles, and giving his
      orders. Then finally he came and made his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is doing very well," he said, "and now, Miss Mary, I have an
      engagement for the theatre for this evening. I think there will be no need
      of me for some hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis started, aghast. "Doctor!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something might happen!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be only two or three blocks away," was the reply&mdash;"They will
      send for me if there is need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this pain!" cried Thyrsis, excitedly. "What is she to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stood by the bedside, washing his hands. "You cannot have a
      child-birth without pain," he said. "These are merely false pains, as we
      call them; the real birth-pains may not come for hours&mdash;perhaps not
      until morning. There are membranes which have to be broken, and muscles
      which have to be stretched&mdash;and there is no way of doing it but this
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with his hand on the doorknob. "Do not be worried," he said.
      "Whatever happens, the attendant will know what to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The theatre!" It seemed so strange! To be sure, it was unreasonable&mdash;if
      a man had several cases each week to attend to, he could not be expected
      to suffer with each one. But at least he need not have mentioned the
      theatre! It gave one such a strange feeling of isolation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. However, he was gone, and Thyrsis turned to Corydon, who lay
      moaning feebly. It was like a knife cutting her, she said; she could not
      bear to lie down, and when she tried to sit up she could not endure the
      weight of her own body. She found it helped her for Thyrsis to support
      her, and so he sat beside her, holding her tightly, while she wrestled
      with her task. The nurse fanned her brow, on which the sweat stood in
      drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis' position strained every muscle in his body; it made each minute
      seem an hour. But he clung there, till his head reeled. Anything to help
      her&mdash;anything, if only he could have helped her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no help; she was gone alone into the silent chamber of pain,
      where there comes no company, no friend, no love. His spirit cried out to
      her, but she heard him not&mdash;she was alone, alone! Is there any
      solitude that the desert or the ocean knows, that is like the solitude of
      suffering?
    </p>
    <p>
      It would come over her in spasms, and Thyrsis could feel her body quiver;
      it would be all he could do to hold her. And minute after minute, hour
      after hour, it was the same, without a moment's respite&mdash;until she
      broke into sobbing, crying that she could not bear it, that she could not
      bear it! She clutched wildly at Thyrsis' hand, and her arms shook like a
      leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran in fright for the elder nurse, who had left the room. She came and
      questioned Corydon, and shook her head. "There is nothing to be done," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But something is wrong!" Thyrsis cried. He had been reading a book, and
      his mind was full of images of all sorts of accidents and horrors, of
      monstrosities and "false presentations." "You must send for the doctor,"
      he repeated, "I know there <i>must</i> be something wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will send for the doctor if you wish," was the reply. "But you must
      order it. The birth has not yet begun, you know&mdash;when it does the
      character of the pains will change altogether, and she will know. Meantime
      there is nothing whatever for the doctor to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might give her an opiate!" Thyrsis exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he did," said the woman, "that would stop the birth. And it must
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they turned once more to the task. Thyrsis bore it until it seemed to
      him that his body was on fire; then he asked the nurse to take his place.
      He reeled as he tried to walk to the sofa; he flung himself down and lay
      panting. Outside he could still hear the busy sounds of the street&mdash;the
      world was going on its way, unknowing, unheeding. There came a chorus of
      merry laughter to him&mdash;his soul was black with revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his post, biting his lips together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only a child&mdash;she was too tender; it was monstrous, he cried.
      Why, she was being torn to pieces! She writhed and quivered, until he
      thought she was in convulsions. And then, little by little, all this faded
      from his thoughts; he had his own pain to bear. He must hold her just so,
      with the grip of a wrestler; his arms ached, and his temples throbbed, and
      he fought with himself and whispered to himself&mdash;he would stay there
      until he dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the doctor never come? It was preposterous for him to leave her like
      this. The time passed on; he was wild with impatience, and suddenly
      Corydon sank back and burst into tears. He could stand it no more, and
      sent for the nurse again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must send for the doctor!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has just come in," the woman answered; "I heard him close the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor entered the room, softly. He was perfectly groomed, clad in
      evening-dress, and with his gloves and his silk hat in his hand. Thyrsis
      hated him at that moment&mdash;hated him with the fury of some tortured
      beast. He was only an assistant; and were not assistants notoriously
      careless? Why had the great surgeon himself not come to see to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does she bear it?" he said, to the nurse; and he took off his
      overcoat and coat, and rolled up his sleeves, while she reported progress.
      Then he felt Corydon's pulse, and after washing his hands, made another
      examination. Thyrsis watched him with his heart in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose without saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has it presented?" the nurse asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," he said, and turned to look at the temperature of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so, then&mdash;there was nothing to be done! Thyrsis was dazed&mdash;he
      could hardly believe it. He had never dreamed it could be anything like
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long is this to last, doctor?" he cried. "She is suffering so
      horribly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear it will be until morning," he said&mdash;"it is a question of the
      rigidity of certain muscles. But you need not be alarmed, she is doing
      very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a few words to the patient, and then turned towards the door. "I
      shall sleep in the next room," he said to his assistant; "you may call me
      at any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. So the two went apart again; and the leaden-footed hours crept
      by, and the girl still wrestled with the fiend. The young nurse was asleep
      on the couch, and the elder sat dozing in her chair; the two were alone&mdash;all
      alone! One of the window-shades was raised, and Thyrsis could see far over
      the tops of the buildings. Somewhere out there was another single light,
      where perhaps some other soul counted the fiery pulses of torture. A death&mdash;or
      another birth, perhaps! The doctor had said it happened twice every
      second!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was unskilled in pain, and perhaps he bore it ill; he feared that
      the nurses thought so too&mdash;that Corydon called too often for
      something, or cried out too much in mere aimless misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the time sped on, and at last a faint streak of day appeared in the
      sky, and the shadows began to pale in the room. Thyrsis started, realizing
      that it was morning. He had given up the morning, as a thing that would
      never come again. He insisted upon sending for the doctor, who came,
      striving not to yawn, but to look pleased. Once more he shook his head;
      there was nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street began to waken. The milkman came, his cans rattling; now and
      then he shouted to his horse, or whistled, or banged upon a gate. Then the
      sun came streaming into the room. The newsboys began to call&mdash;the
      young nurse woke up and began to straighten her hair. The elder nurse also
      opened her eyes, but did not stir; she seemed to challenge anyone to
      assert that she had ever been asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, Miss Mary," ventured the young nurse, timidly, "we had best
      prepare the patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon seemed to rest a little easier now, and they carried her and laid
      her on the couch. They made the bed, with many sheets and with elaborate
      care; and then they brought her back and dressed her, putting a short gown
      upon her, and drawing long white bags over her limbs. Ah, how white she
      was, and what fearful lines of suffering had been graven into her
      forehead!
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay in a kind of stupor, and Thyrsis, exhausted, began to doze. He
      knew not how long a time had passed&mdash;it had been an hour, perhaps
      two, when suddenly he opened his eyes and sat up with a bound galvanized
      into life by a cry from Corydon. She had started forward, grasping around
      her wildly, uttering a series of rising screams. He clutched her hand, and
      stared around the room in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone. He leaped up; but the nurse ran into the room at the same
      instant. She gazed at the girl, whose face had flushed suddenly purple;
      she came to her, and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You feel some pain?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon could not speak, but she nodded; a moment later she sunk back with
      a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A kind of bearing-down pain?" said the nurse. "Different from the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon gasped her assent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the birth," the nurse said. "The doctor will be here in a
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the horrible spasm seized the girl, and brought her to a sitting
      posture; again her hand clutched Thyrsis' with a grip like death, and
      again the veins on her forehead leaped out. Like the surging of an ocean
      billow, it seemed to sweep over her; and then suddenly she screamed, and
      sank back upon the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was wild with alarm; but the doctor entered, placid as ever. "So
      they've come?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed to disturb him. He was like a being out of another region.
      He took off his coat and bared his arms; he put on a long white apron, and
      washed his hands elaborately again, and then once more examined his
      patient. His face was opposite to Thyrsis, and the latter watched his
      expression, breathless with dread. But the doctor only said, "Ah, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Corydon. "These pains that you feel," he said, "are from the
      compressing of the womb. Don't let them frighten you&mdash;everything is
      just as it should be. You will find that you can help at each pang by
      holding your breath; just as soon as you cry out, it releases the
      diaphragm, and the pressure stops, and the pain passes. You must bear each
      one just as long as you can. I don't want you to faint, of course&mdash;but
      the longer the pressure lasts, the sooner it will all be over."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was staring at him with her wild eyes&mdash;she looked like a
      hunted creature in a trap. It sounded all so very simple&mdash;but the
      horror of it drove Thyrsis mad. Ah, God, it was monstrous&mdash;it was
      superhuman&mdash;it was a thing beyond all thinking! It wrung all his
      soul, it shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf&mdash;the sight of this
      awful agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the sudden closing of a battle; the shock of squadrons, the
      locking of warriors in a grip of death. There was no longer time for words
      now, no longer time for a glance about him; the spasms came, one after
      another, relentless, unceasing, inevitable&mdash;each trooping upon the
      heels of the last; they were uncounted&mdash;uncountable&mdash;piling upon
      one another like waves upon the sea, like the gusts of a raging storm. And
      this girl, this child, that he had watched over so hungrily, that was so
      tender and so sensitive&mdash;it was like wild horses tearing her apart!
      The agony would flame up in her, he would see her body turn rigid, her
      face flush scarlet, her teeth become set and her gums fleshed. The muscles
      would stand out in her cheeks, the perspiration start upon her forehead.
      She would grip Thyrsis' hand until all the might of both his arms was not
      enough to match her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the bed knelt the young nurse, wrestling with the
      other hand; and Thyrsis could see her face flush too, each time&mdash;until
      at last a cry seem to tear its way from the girl's throat, and would sink
      back, faint and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new aspect of life to Thyrsis, a new revelation of being; it was
      pain such as he had never dreamed it was horror the like of which was
      unknown in his philosophy. All the suffering of the night was nothing to a
      minute of this; it came upon her with the rush of a flood of waters&mdash;it
      seized her&mdash;instant, insistent, relentless as the sweep of the
      planets. Thyrsis had been all unprepared for it; he cried out for time to
      think&mdash;to realize it. But there was no time to think or to realize
      it. The thing was here&mdash;now! It glared into his eyes like a fiend of
      hell; it was fiery, sharp as steel&mdash;and it had to be seized with the
      naked hands!
    </p>
    <p>
      The pangs came, each one worse than the last. They built themselves up in
      his soul in a symphony of terror; they lifted him out of himself, they
      swept him away beyond all control, like a leaf in the autumn wind. He had
      never known such a sensation before&mdash;his soul seemed whirled into
      pieces. His feeling was apart from his action; he could not control his
      thoughts; he was going mad! He loved her so&mdash;she was so beautiful;
      and to see her thus, in the grip of horror!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to get hold of himself again&mdash;he talked to himself, pinning
      his attention on the task of his hands. Perhaps maybe it was his fancy&mdash;it
      did not really hurt her so! Maybe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her, calling to her, in between the crises. She turned her
      eyes upon him, looking unutterable agony; she could not speak. And then
      again came the spasm, and she reared herself to meet it. She seemed to
      loom before his eyes; she was no longer human, but in her agony
      transfigured. She was the suffering of being, made flesh; a figure epic,
      colossal, worthy of an Angelo; the mighty mother herself, the
      earth-mother, from whose womb have come the races!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;"Perhaps she would be more comfortable with another
      pillow," said the doctor, and the spell was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon shook her head with swift impatience. This was her conflict, the
      gesture seemed to say. They had only to let her alone&mdash;she had no
      words to spare for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long does this last?" Thyrsis asked, his voice trembling. The doctor
      made a motion to him to be silent&mdash;evidently he did not wish Corydon
      to hear the answer to that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. For the girl's soul was rising within her; perhaps from the deeps
      of things there came comfort to her, from the everlasting, universal
      motherhood of life. Nature must have told her that this at least was pain
      to some purpose; something was being accomplished. And she shut her jaws
      together again, and closed with it&mdash;driving, driving, with all the
      power of her being. A feeling of awe stole over Thyrsis as he watched her&mdash;a
      feeling the like of which he had never known in his life before. She was a
      creature consecrated, made holy by suffering; she was the sacredness of
      life incarnate, a thing godlike, beyond earth. It came as a revelation,
      changing the whole aspect of life to him. It was hard to realize&mdash;that
      woman, woman who endured this, was the same being that he had met in the
      world all his life&mdash;laughing and talking, careless and commonplace.
      This&mdash;this was woman's <i>fate</i>! It was the thing for which woman
      was made, and the lowest, meanest of them might have to bear it! He swore
      vows of reverence and knighthood; he fell upon his knees before her,
      weeping, his soul white-hot with awe. Ah what should he do that he might
      be worthy to live upon the earth with a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was no mere fine emotion; there was no room for imagination in it&mdash;the
      reality exceeded all imagination. Overwhelming it was, furious,
      relentless; his thoughts strove to roam, but it seized him by the hair and
      dragged him back. Here&mdash;<i>here!</i>

    <p>
      She was wrung and shaken with her agony, her eyes shut, her face uplifted,
      her muscles turned to stone. And the minutes dragged out into hours&mdash;there
      was no end to it&mdash;there was no end to it! There was no meaning&mdash;it
      was only naked, staring terror. It beat him up again and again; he would
      sink back exhausted, thinking that he could feel no more; but it dragged
      him up once more&mdash;to agony without respite! The caverns of horror
      were rent open; they split before his eyes&mdash;deeper, deeper&mdash;in
      vistas and abysses from which he shrunk appalled. Here dwelt the furies,
      despair and madness&mdash;here dwelt the demon-forces of being, grisly
      phantoms which come not into the light of day. Their hands were upon him,
      their claws were in his flesh; and over their chasms he shuddered&mdash;he
      scented the smoke of that seething pit of life, whose top the centuries
      have sealed, and into which no mortal thing may gaze and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life&mdash;life&mdash;here was life, he felt. What had he known of it
      before this?&mdash;the rest was pageantry and sham. Beauty, pleasure, love&mdash;here
      they were in the making of them&mdash;here they were in the real truth of
      them! Raw, naked, hideous it was; and it was the source of all things
      else! His being rose in one titan throb of rebellion. It was monstrous&mdash;it
      was unthinkable! He wanted no such life&mdash;he had no right to it! Let
      there be an end of it! No life that ever was could be worth such a price
      as this! It was a cheat, a horror&mdash;there could be no justice in such
      a thing! There could be no God in it&mdash;it was oppression, it was
      wrong! He thought of the millions that swarmed on the earth&mdash;they had
      all come from this! And it was happening every hour&mdash;every second! He
      saw it, the whole of it&mdash;the age-long agony, the universal birth-pang
      of being. And he hated it, hated it with a wild, raging hatred&mdash;he
      would have annihilated it with one sweep of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;there was no way to annihilate it! It was here&mdash;it was
      inevitable. And it was everlasting&mdash;it was an everlasting delusion,
      an everlasting madness. It was a Snare!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he came back to the thought&mdash;that was the image for it! It
      mattered not how much you might cry out, you were in it, and it held you!
      It held you as it held Corydon, in throb after throb of torment. She
      moaned, she choked, she tossed from side to side; but it held her. It
      seemed to him that the storm of her agony beat upon her like the tempest
      upon a mountain pine-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. The doctor's hands were red with blood now, like a butcher's. He
      bent over his work, his lips set. Now and then he would speak to the young
      nurse, whom he was teaching; and his words would break the spell of
      Thyrsis' nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can see the head now," he said once, turning to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis looked; through the horrible gaping showed a little patch, the
      size of a dollar&mdash;purplish black, palpitating, starting forward when
      the crises shook the mother. "And that is a head!" he whispered, half
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can it ever get out?" he cried suddenly with wildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will get out," the doctor answered, smiling. "Wait&mdash;you will
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the baby will be dead!" he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very much alive," replied the other. "I can hear its heart beating
      plainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while Thyrsis had never really believed in the child&mdash;it was
      too strange an idea. He could think only of the woman, and of her endless
      agony. Every minute seemed a life-time to him&mdash;the long morning had
      come and gone, and still she lay in her torment. He was sick in body, and
      sick in soul; she had exerted the strength of a dozen men, it seemed to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now her strength was failing her, he was certain; her moans were
      becoming more frequent, her protests more vehement. The veins stood out on
      the doctor's forehead as he worked with her&mdash;muscular, like a
      pugilist. Gigantic, he seemed to Thyrsis&mdash;terrible as fate. Time and
      again the girl screamed, in sudden agony; he would toil on, his lips set.
      Once it was too much even for him&mdash;her cries had become incessant,
      and he nodded to the nurse, who took a bottle from the table, and wetting
      a cloth with it, held it to Corydon's face. Then she shouted aloud, again
      and again&mdash;wildly, and more wildly, laughing hysterically; she began
      flinging her arms about&mdash;and then calling to Thyrsis, as her eyes
      closed, murmuring broken sentences of love, "babbling o' green fields." It
      was too much for the boy&mdash;there was a choking in his throat, and he
      rushed from the room and sank down upon a chair in the hall, crying like a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he rose up. He paced the hall, talking to himself. He could
      not go on acting in this way&mdash;he must be a man. Others had borne this&mdash;he
      would bear it too; he would get himself together. It would all be over
      before long, and then how he would be ashamed of himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back. "It is the chloroform that makes her do that," said the
      young nurse, soothingly. "She is out of pain when she cries out so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon was coming back from her stupor; the strife began again. She cried
      out for its end, she could bear no more. "Help me! Help me!" she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head was the size of a saucer now&mdash;but each time that she
      screamed it would go back. Thyrsis stood up to get the strength to grip
      her hand; her face stared up into the air, looking like the face of a
      wolf. And still there was no end&mdash;no end!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an hour more of that&mdash;the room seemed to Thyrsis to reel.
      Corydon was crying, moaning that she wished to die. There was now in sight
      a huge, bulging object&mdash;black, monstrous&mdash;rimmed with a band of
      bleeding, straining flesh, tight like the top of a drum. The doctor was
      bent over, toiling, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more! No more!" screamed the girl. "Oh, my God! my God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the doctor answered her, panting: "Once more! once more! Now! now!"
      And so on, for minute after minute; luring her on, pleading with her,
      promising her, lying to her&mdash;"Once more! Once more! This will be the
      last!" He called to her, he rallied her; he signalled to Thyrsis to help
      him&mdash;to inspire her, to goad her to new endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then another titan effort, and suddenly&mdash;incredibly&mdash;there
      burst upon Thyrsis' sight an apparition. Sick at heart, numb with horror,
      dazed&mdash;he scarcely knew what it was. It happened so swiftly that he
      had hardly time to see; but something leaped forth something enormous,
      supernatural! It came&mdash;it came&mdash;there seemed never to be an end
      to it! He started to his feet, staring, crying out; and at the same moment
      the doctor lifted the thing aloft, with a cry of exultation. He held it
      dangling by one leg. Great God! It was a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      A man! A thing with the head of a man, the body of a man, the legs and
      arms, the face of a man! A thing hideous&mdash;impish&mdash;demoniac! A
      thing purple and dripping with blood&mdash;ghastly&mdash;unthinkable&mdash;monstrous&mdash;a
      spectre of nightmare dreams!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly the doctor lifted his hand and smote it; and the mouth of the
      thing opened, and there came forth a purplish froth&mdash;and then a cry!
      It was a sound like a tin-pan beaten&mdash;a sound that was itself a
      living presence, an apparition; a thing superhuman, out of another world&mdash;like
      the wailing of a lost spirit, terrifying to every sense! With Thyrsis it
      was like the falling down of towers within him&mdash;his whole being
      collapsed, and he sunk down upon the bed, sobbing, choking, convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. When he looked up again the elder nurse had the baby in her
      arms; and there was a wan smile on Corydon's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's hand was in the ghastly wound, and he was talking to the
      young nurse, giving her instruction, in a strange, monotonous tone. "The
      placenta," he was saying, "often has to be removed; we do it by twisting
      it round and round&mdash;very gently, of course. Then it comes&mdash;so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a rush of blood, and Thyrsis turned away his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me the basin," said the doctor. "There!&mdash;And now the next thing
      is to see that the uterus contracts immediately. We assist it by
      compressing the walls, thus. It must be tightly bandaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had turned to see the child. He looked at it, and clenched his
      hands to control his emotions. Yes, it was a man! it was a man! Not a
      monster, not a demon&mdash;a baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      His boy! himself! God, what a ghastly thing to realize! It had his
      forehead, it had his nose! It was a caricature of himself! A caricature
      grotesque and impish, and yet one that no human being could mistake&mdash;a
      caricature by the hand of a master!
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was a living thing! It had power of motion&mdash;it twisted and
      writhed, it bent its arms and legs! It winked its eyelids, it opened and
      shut its mouth, it breathed and made sounds! And it had feeling, too! It
      had cried out when it was struck!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently, with one finger, he touched it; and the contact with its flesh
      sent a shudder through every nerve of him. His child! His child! And a
      living child! A creature that would go on; that would eat and sleep and
      grow, that would learn to make sounds, and to understand things! That
      would come to think and to will! That would be a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it&mdash;is it all right?" he asked the nurse, in a trembling whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a magnificent boy," she said. And then she struck a match, and held
      the light in front of its eyes; and the eyes turned to follow the light.
      "He sees!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he could see! And Thyrsis had already heard that he could speak! What
      could it not do&mdash;this marvellous object! It was Nature's supreme
      miracle&mdash;it was the answer to all the riddles, the solution of all
      the mysteries! It was a vindication of the subterfuges, a reward for the
      sacrifices, a balm for the pain! It was the thing for which all the rest
      had been, it was the crown and consummation of their love&mdash;it was
      Life's supreme shout of triumph and exultation!
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was holding the child up before Corydon; and she was gazing at
      it, she was feeding her eyes upon it. And oh, the smile that came upon her
      face&mdash;the ineffable smile! The pride, and the relief, and the
      beatific happiness! This thing she had done&mdash;it was her act of
      creation! Her battle that had been fought, her victory that had been won;
      and now they brought her the crown and the guerdon! To Thyrsis there came
      suddenly the words of Jesus: "A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
      because her hour hath come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child,
      she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the
      world." And he sunk down beside the bed, and caught the woman's hand in
      his, and began to sob softly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. Later on he went into the street. Evening was come again&mdash;for
      twenty-two hours that siege had lasted! And the boy had eaten nothing
      since noon of the day before, and he was weak and dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how strange the world seemed to him all at once! Peopled with phantom
      creatures, that came he knew not whence, and went he knew not whither!
      Creatures of awe and horror, who came out of chaos, and went back into
      annihilation! Who were flung here and there by cosmic forces, played with
      by tragic destinies! And all of them without any sense of the perpetual
      marvel of their own being! They ate and dressed and slept, they laughed
      and played and worked, they hated and loved and got and spent, with no
      thought of the wonder of their lightest breath, with no sense of the
      terrors that ringed them about&mdash;the storms that swept them hither and
      thither, the million miracles that were wrought for them every instant of
      their lives!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into a restaurant, and sat down; and in the seat beside him, close
      at his elbow, was a man. He was a fat man&mdash;eating roast pork, and
      apple-sauce, and mashed potatoes, and bread. And Thyrsis looked at him
      with wondering eyes. "Man," he imagined himself saying, "do you know how
      you came into this world? A thing impish, demoniac&mdash;purple and
      dripping with blood&mdash;a spectre of nightmare dreams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-what?" the man gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you know nothing of the pain that it cost! You have no sense of the
      strangeness of it! You never think what your coming meant to some woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;in the seat opposite was a woman; and Thyrsis watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" he thought, "a woman! Can it be that you know what you are? The
      fate that you play with&mdash;the power that dwells in you! To create new
      life, that may be handed down through endless ages!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis did not say these things; they were what he wanted to say&mdash;what
      he thought that he ought to say. But then he reminded himself that these
      things were forbidden; these mighty facts of child-birth, of life-creation&mdash;they
      might not be spoken about! They must be kept hidden, veiled with mystery&mdash;if
      one wished to refer to them, he must employ metaphors and polite evasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Thyrsis sat and thought about this, he clenched his hands. Some day
      the world would hear about it&mdash;some day the world would think about
      it! Some day people would behold life&mdash;would realize what it was and
      what it meant. They did not realize it now&mdash;else how could it be that
      women, who bore the race with so much pain and sorrow, should be drudges
      and slaves, or the ornaments and playthings of men? Else how could it be
      that life, which cost such a fearful price, should be so cheap upon the
      earth? For every man that lived and walked alive, some woman had had to
      bear this agony; and yet men were pent up in mines and sweatshops, they
      were ground up in accidents in factories and mills&mdash;nay, worse than
      that, were dressed up in gaudy uniforms, and armed with rifles and
      machine-guns, and marched out to slaughter each other by tens and hundreds
      of thousands!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as he walked the streets that night, Thyrsis made a vow. Some day he
      would put before the world this vision that had come to him, some day he
      would blast men's souls with it. He would shake them with this horror, he
      would thrill them with this sense of the infinite preciousness and
      holiness of life! He would drive it into them like a barbed arrow&mdash;that
      never afterwards in all their lives would they be rid of. Never afterwards
      would they dare to mock, never afterwards would they be able to rest until
      these things had been done away with, until these horrors had been driven
      from the earth.

      <i>They sat with the twilight shadows about them. Memories too poignant
      assailed them, and her hand trembled as it lay upon his arm. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange it was!" she whispered. "Have we kept the faith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows?" he answered; and in a low voice he read&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "And long the way appears, which seem'd so short
        To the less practised eye of sanguine youth;
            And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air,
        The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth,
            Tops in life's morning-sun so bright and bare!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. This was a golden hour in Thyrsis' life. The gates of wonder were
      flung open, and all things were touched with a new and mystic glow. He
      scarcely realized it at the time; for once he was too much moved to think
      about his own emotions, the artist was altogether lost in the man. Even
      the room in which he lodged was relieved of its sordidness; it was a thing
      that men had made, and so a part of the mystery of becoming. He yearned
      for some one to whom he could impart his great emotion; but because of the
      loneliness of his life he could find no one but the keeper of his
      lodging-house. Even she became a human thing to him, because of her
      interest in the great tidings. If all the world loved a lover, it loved
      yet more one through whom the supreme purpose of love had been
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went each day to the hospital, to watch the new miracle unfolding
      itself; to see the Child asserting its existence as a being with a life of
      its own. He could never tire of watching it; he watched it asleep, with
      the faint heaving of its body, and the soft, warm odor that clung to it;
      he watched its awakenings&mdash;the opening of its eyes, and the sucking
      movements that it made perpetually with its lips. They had dressed it up
      now, and hid some of its strangeness; but each morning the nurse would
      undress it, and give it a bath; and then he marvelled at the short crooked
      legs, and the tiny red hands that clutched incessantly at the air, and the
      strange prehensile feet, that carried one back to distant ages, hinting at
      the secrets of Nature's workshop. Sometimes they would permit him to hold
      this mystic creature in his arms&mdash;after much exhortation, and
      assurance that his left arm was properly placed at the back of its head.
      One found out in this way what a serious business life really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon lay back among her pillows and smiled at these things. Most
      wonderful it was to him to see how swiftly she recovered from her ordeal,
      how hourly the flush of health seemed to steal back into her cheeks. He
      became ashamed of the memory of his convulsive anguish and his blind
      rebellions. He saw now that her pain had not been as other pain; it was a
      constructive pain, a part of the task of her life. It was a battle in
      which she had fought and conquered; and now she sat, throned in her
      triumphal chariot, acclaimed by the plaudits of a multitude of hopes and
      joys unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the miracle of the milk. Incessantly the Child's lips moved,
      and its hands groped out; it was an embodied demand for new experience&mdash;for
      life, it knew not what. But Nature knew, and had timed the event to this
      hour. And Thyrsis watched the phenomenon, marvelling&mdash;as one marvels
      at the feat of engineers, who tunnel from opposite sides of a mountain,
      and meet in the centre without the error of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in accordance with the impression which Corydon made upon him, as a
      dispenser of abundance, a goddess of fruitfulness, that there should have
      been more milk than the Child needed. The balance had to be drawn off with
      a little vacuum-pump; and Thyrsis would watch the tiny jets as they
      sprayed upon the glass bulb. The milk was rich and golden-hued; he tasted
      it, with mingled wonder and shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      These procedures filled the room with a warm, luscious odor, as of a
      dairy; they were eminently domestic procedures, such as in fancy he had
      been wont to tease her about. But he had few jests at present&mdash;he was
      in the inner chambers of the temple of life, and hushed and stilled with
      awe. The things that he had witnessed in that room were never to be
      forgotten; each hour he pledged himself anew, to the uttermost limits of
      his life. The voice of skeptic reason was altogether silent in him now.
      And also he was interested to observe that all protest was ended in
      Corydon; the impulses of motherhood had now undisputed sway in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. BUT even in such an hour of consecration, the sordid world
      outside would not leave him unmolested. It was as if the black clouds had
      parted for a moment, while the sunlight poured through; and now again they
      rolled together. The great surgeon, who had told Thyrsis that he would
      wait for his money, professed now to have forgotten his agreement. Perhaps
      he had really forgotten it&mdash;who could tell, with the many things he
      had upon his mind? At any rate, Corydon found herself suddenly confronted
      with a bill, which she was powerless to pay; with white cheeks and
      trembling lips she told Thyrsis about it&mdash;and so came more worry and
      humiliation. The very food that she ate became tasteless to her, because
      she felt she had no right to it; and in a few days she was begging Thyrsis
      to take her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he helped to carry her downstairs, and back to her parents' home; and
      then he returned to his own lonely room, and sat for hours in the bitter
      cold, with his teeth set tightly, and the nails dug into the palms of his
      hands. It so happened that just then the editor was beginning to change
      his mind about "The Hearer of Truth"; and so he had new agonies of anxiety
      and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he might not come to see Corydon; and this led to a great
      misfortune. For she could not do without him now, her craving for him was
      an obsession; and so she left her bed too soon, and climbed the stairs to
      his room. Again and again she did this, in spite of his protests; and
      when, a little later, the doctors found that she had what they called
      "womb-trouble", they attributed it to this. Perhaps it was not really so,
      but Corydon believed it, and through all the years she laid upon it the
      blame for innumerable headaches and backaches. Thus an episode that might
      have been soon forgotten, stayed with her, as the symbol of all the
      agonies of which her life was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would come, bringing the baby with her; and they would lay it upon the
      bed, and then sit and talk, for hours upon hours, wrestling with their
      problems. Later on, when Corydon was able, they would go to the park,
      craving the fresh air. But in midwinter there were few days when they
      could sit upon a bench for long; and so they would walk and walk, until
      Corydon was exhausted, and he would have to help her back to the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis in these days was like a wild animal in a cage; pacing back and
      forth and testing every corner of his prison. But they never thought of
      giving up; never in all their lives did that possibility come into their
      discourse. And doggedly, blindly, they kept on with their studies. Corydon
      mastered new lists of German words, and they read Freitag's "Verlorene
      Handscrift" together, and von Scheffel's "Ekkehard", and even attempted
      "Iphigenie auf Tauris"&mdash;though in truth they found it difficult to
      detach themselves to quite that extent from the world of every-day. It is
      not an easy matter to experience the pure <i>katharsis</i> of tragedy,
      with a baby in the room who has to be nursed every hour or two, and who is
      liable to awaken at any moment and make some demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was such an intricate and complicated baby, with so many things to be
      understood&mdash;belly-bands and diapers and irrational length of skirts.
      Sometimes, when Corydon was quite exhausted, the attending to these
      matters fell to Thyrsis, who became for the time a most domestic poet. He
      once sent an editorial-room into roars of merriment by offering to review
      a book upon the feeding of infants. But he told himself that even the
      hilarious editors had been infants once upon a time; and he had divined
      that there were secrets about life to be learned, and great art-works to
      be dreamed, even amid belly-bands and diapers. Also, Thyrsis would brave a
      great deal of ridicule in order to be paid a dollar for the reading of a
      book that he really wanted to read. For books that one wanted to read came
      so seldom; and dollars were so difficult to earn!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if the task grew harder every week. He went without cuffs,
      and wore old and frayed collars, and washed his solitary necktie until it
      was threadbare, and lived upon prunes and crackers, and gave up the
      gas-stove in his room&mdash;and still he could scarcely manage to get
      together the weekly rent. He studied the magazines in the libraries, and
      racked his wits for new ideas to interest their editors. He haunted
      editorial-rooms until his presence became a burden, and he brought new
      agonies and humiliations upon himself. He would part from Corydon in the
      afternoon, and shut himself in his room; and sitting in bed to keep warm,
      he would work until midnight at some new variety of pot-boiler. After
      which he would go out to walk and clear his brain&mdash;and even then,
      exhausted as he was, his vision would come to him again, wonderful and
      soul-shaking. So he would walk on, and go back to write until nearly dawn
      at something he really loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. It was so that he wrote his poem, "Caradrion". It was out of
      thoughts of Corydon, and of the tears which they shed in each other's
      presence, that this poem was made. Thyrsis had a fondness for burrowing
      into strange old books, in which one found the primitive wonder of the
      soul of man, first awakening to the mystery of life. Such a book was
      Physiologus, with his tales of strange beasts and magic jewels. "There is
      a bird called Caradrion", Thyrsis had read.... "And if the sick man can be
      healed, Caradrion goes to him, and touches him upon the mouth, and takes
      his sickness from him; and so the man is made well." And out of this hint
      he had fashioned the legend of the two children who had grown up together
      in "the little cot, fringed round with tender green"; one of them Cedric,
      and one Eileen&mdash;for he had given the names that Corydon preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      They grew "unto the days of love", so the story ran&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "And Cedric bent above her, stooping light,
    To press a kiss upon her tender cheek.
    And said, 'Eileen, I love thee; yea I love,
    And loved thee ever, thou my soul's delight.'
</pre>
    <p>
      So time sped on, until there came
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "To Cedric once a strange unlovely thought,
    That haunted him and would not let him be.
    'Eileen,' he said, 'there is a thing called death,
    Of which men speak with trembling at the lips;
    And I have thought how it would be with me
    If I should never gaze upon thee more.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      So Cedric went to find out about these matters; he sought a witch&mdash;"the
      haggard woman, held in awe."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "He found her crouching by a caldron fire;
    Far gleams of light fled through the vault away.
    And tongues of darkness flickered on the wall.
    Then Cedric said, 'I seek the fate to know'.
    And the witch laughed, and gazed on him and sang:

   'Fashioned in the shadow-land,
        Out into darkness hurled;
    Trusted to the Storm-wind's hand,
        By the Passion-tempest whirled!
            Ever straining,
            Never gaining,
            Never keeping,
                Young or old!
            Whither going
            Never knowing,
            Wherefore weeping,
                Never told!
    Rising, falling, disappearing,
    Seeking, calling, hating, fearing;
    Blasted by the lightning shock,
    Trampled in the earthquake rock;
    Were I man I would not plead
    In the roll of fate to read!'

   "Then Cedric shuddered, but he said again,
    'I seek the fate,' and the witch waved her hand;
    And straight a peal of thunder shook the ground,
    And clanged and battered on the cavern walls,
    Like some huge boulder leaping down the cliff.
    And blinding light flashed out, and seething fire
    Shattered the seamy crags and heaving floor."
</pre>
    <p>
      And so in a vision of terror Cedric saw the little vale, and the cot
      "fringed round with tender green"; and upon the lawn he saw Eileen, lying
      as one dead.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "And Cedric sprang, and cried, 'My love! Eileen!'
    And on the instant came a thunder-crash
    Like to the sound of old primeval days,
    Of mountain-heaving shock and earthquake roar,
    Of whirling planets shattered in the dark."
</pre>
    <p>
      And so, half wild with grief and despair, Cedric wandered forth into the
      world; and after great suffering, the birds took pity upon him, and gave
      him advice&mdash;that he should seek Caradrion.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Caradrion?' cried Cedric, starting up,
    'Speak swiftly, ere too late, where dwelleth he?'
    'Ah, that I know not,' spake the little voice,
    'Yet keep thy courage, seek thou out the stork,
    The ancient stork that saw from earliest days,
    Sitting in primal contemplation lost,
    Sphinx-like, seraphic, and oracular,
    Watching the strange procession of men's dreams.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      But the stork was cruel and would not heed him, and led Cedric a weary
      chase through the marshes and the brakes. But Cedric pursued, and finally
      seized the bird by the throat, and forced the secret from him&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "'Fare southward still,
    Fronting the sun's midnoon, all-piercing shaft,
    Unto the land where daylight burns as fire;
    Where the rank earth in choking vapor steams,
    And fierce luxurious vegetation reeks.
    So shalt thou come upon a seamèd rock,
    Towering to meet the sun's fierce-flashing might,
    Baring its granite forehead to the sky.
    There on its summit, in a cavern deep,
    Dwells what thou seekest, half a bird, half man,
    Caradrion, the consecrate to pain.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Then came the long journey and the search for the seamèd rock.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Twas night; and vapors, curling, choked the ground,
    And the rock writhed like flesh of one in pain.
    But Cedric mounted up to find the cave,
    Crying aloud: 'I seek Caradrion.'
    And so, till from the cavern depth a voice:
    'Come not, except to sorrow thou be born.'
    And Cedric, panting, stretched his shrunken arms:
    'Another's sorrow would I change to joy,
    And mine own joy to sorrow; help thou me.'
    To which the voice, sunk low, replied: 'Come thou.'
    And Cedric came, unfearing, in the dark,
    And saw in gloomy night a form in pain,
    With wings stretched wide, and beating faint and fast.
    'Art thou Caradrion?' he murmured swift,
    And echo gave reply, 'Caradrion'."
</pre>
    <p>
      So Cedric told of his errand, and pleaded for help; he heard the answer of
      the voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Yea, I can save her, if thou be a soul
    That can dare pain and face the rage of fate;
    A soul that feareth not to look on death.'
    'Speak on,' said Cedric, shaking, and he spoke:
    'This is my law, that am Caradrion,
    Whose way is sorrow and whose end is death;
    That by my pain some fleeting grace I win,
    Some joy unto another I can give.
    Far through this world of woe I seek, and find
    Some soul crushed utterly, and steeped in pain;
    And when it sleeps, I stoop on silent wing,
    And with a kiss take all its woe away&mdash;
    Take it for mine, and then into this cave
    Return alone, the blessing's price to pay.'
    Then up sprang Cedric. 'Nay,' he,' cried, 'then swift,
    Ere life be gone!' But once more spake the voice:
    'Nay, boy, my race is run, my power is spent;
    This hope alone I give thee, as thou wilt;
    Whoso stands by and sees my heart-throb cease,
    Who tastes its blood, my power and form are his,
    And forth he fares in solitary flight,
    Caradrion, the consecrate to pain.
    And so my word is said; now hide thee far
    In the cave's night, and wrestle there in prayer.'
    But Cedric said, 'My prayer is done; I wait.'
    So in the cave the hours of night sped by,
    And sounds came forth as when a woman fights
    In savage pain a life from hers to free."
</pre>
    <p>
      Then in the dawn a dark shadow flew from the cave, and sped across the
      blue, and came to the little vale, where Eileen lay dying, as he had seen
      her in the vision in the "haggard woman's" cavern.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Then Cedric sprang, and cried, 'My love! Eileen!'
    And Eileen heard him not; nor knew he wept.&mdash;
    For mighty sorrow burst from out his heart,
    And flooded all his being, and he sunk,
    And moaned: 'Eileen, I love thee! Yea, I love,
    And loved thee ever; and I can not think
    That I shall never gaze upon thee more.
    My life for thine&mdash;ah, that were naught to give,
    Meant not the gift to see thee nevermore!
    Never to hear thy voice. Nay, nay, Eileen,
    Gaze on me, speak to me, give me but one word,
    And I will go and never more return.'
    But Eileen answered not; he touched her hand,
    And she felt nothing. Then he whispered, low,
    'Oh, may God keep thee&mdash;for it must be done&mdash;
    Guard thee, and bless thee, thou my soul's delight!
    And when thou waken'st, wilt thou think of me,
    Of Cedric, him that loved thee, oh so true?
    Nay, for they said thou shouldst no sorrow know,
    And that would be a sorrow, yea, it would.
    And must thou then forget me, thou my love?
    And canst not give me but one single word,
    To tell me that I do not die in vain?
    Gaze at me, Eileen, see, thy love is here,
    Here as of old, above thee stooping light,
    To press a kiss upon thy tender lips.&mdash;
    Ah, I can kiss thee&mdash;kiss thee, my Eileen,
    Kiss as of yore, with all my passion's woe!'
    And as he spoke he pressed her to his heart,
    Long, long, with yearning, and he felt the leap
    Of molten metal through his throbbing veins;
    His eyes shot fire, and anguish racked his limbs,
    And he fell back, and reeled, and clutched his brow.
    An instant only gazed he on her face,
    And saw new life within her gray cheek leap,
    And her dark eyelids tremble. Then with moan,
    And fearful struggle, swift he fled away,
    That she might nothing of his strife perceive.
    And then, reminded of his gift of flight,
    He started from the earth, and beat aloft,
    Each sweep of his great wings a torture-stroke
    Upon his fainting heart. And thus away,
    With languid flight he moved, and Eileen, raised
    In new-born joy from off her couch of pain,
    Saw a strange bird into the distance fade."
</pre>
    <p>
      And so Cedric went back to the seamèd rock, and there he heard a voice
      calling, "I seek Caradrion!" And as before he answered,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Come not, except to sorrow thou be born!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And again, in the cave&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "The hours of night sped by.
    And sounds came forth as when a woman fights
    In savage pain, a life from hers to free.

    But Eileen dwelt within the happy vale,
    Thinking no thought of him that went away."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 4. This had come so very easily to Thyrsis that he could not believe
      that it was good. "Just a little story," he said to Corydon, when he read
      it to her, and he was surprised to see how it affected her&mdash;how the
      tears welled into her eyes, and she clung to him sobbing. It meant more to
      her than any other thing that he had written; it was the very voice of
      their tenderness and their grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyrsis took it to the one editor he knew who was a lover of poetry,
      and was surprised again, at this man's delight. But he smiled sadly as he
      realized that the editor did not use poetry&mdash;they did not praise so
      recklessly when it was a question of something to be purchased!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poem is too long for any magazine," was the verdict, "and it's not
      long enough for a book. And besides, poetry doesn't sell." But none the
      less Thyrsis, who would never take a defeat, began to offer it about; and
      so "Caradrion" was added to the list of stamp-consuming manuscripts, and
      set out to see the world at the expense of its creator's stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was one more wasted vision, one more futile effort&mdash;and one
      more grapple with despair, in the hours when he and his wife sat wrapped
      in a blanket in the tenement-room. Corydon was growing more nervous and
      unhappy every day, it seemed to him. There were, apparently, endless
      humiliations to be experienced by a woman "whose husband did not support
      her". Some zealous relative had suggested to her the idea that the
      "hall-boys" might think she was not really married; and so now she was
      impelled to speculate upon the psychology of these Ethiopian
      functionaries, and look for slights and disapproval from them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis, from much work and little sleep, was haggard and wild of aspect;
      the cry of the world, "Take a position!" rang in his ears day and night.
      The springs of book-reviews had dried up entirely, and by sheer starvation
      he was forced to a stage lower yet. A former college friend was editing a
      work of "contemporary biography", and offered Thyrsis some hack-writing.
      It meant the carrying home of huge bundles of correspondence from the
      world's most brightly-shining lights, and the making up of biographical
      sketches from their eulogies of themselves. With every light there came a
      portrait, showing what manner of light it was. As for Thyrsis, he did his
      writing with the feeling that he would like to explore with a poniard the
      interiors of each one of these people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly three months now an eminent editor had been trying to summon up
      the courage to accept "The Hearer of Truth". He had written several
      letters to tell the author how good a work it was; and now that it was to
      be definitely rejected, he soothed his conscience by inviting the author
      to lunch. The function came off at one of the most august and stately of
      the city's clubs, a marble building near Fifth Avenue, where Thyrsis, with
      a new clean collar, and his worn shoes newly shined, passed under the
      suspicious eyes of the liveried menials, and was ushered before the
      eminent editor. About the vast room were portraits of bygone dignitaries;
      and there were great leather-upholstered arm-chairs in which one might see
      the dignitaries of the present&mdash;some of them with little tables at
      their sides, and decanters and soda and cracked ice. They went into the
      dining-room, where everyone spoke and ate in whispers, and the waiters
      flitted about like black and white ghosts; and while Thyrsis consumed a
      cupful of cold <i>bouillon</i>, and a squab <i>en casserole</i>, and a
      plate of what might be described as an honorific salad, he listened to the
      soft-voiced editor discussing the problem of his future career.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor's theme was what the public wanted. The world had existed for a
      long time, it seemed, and was not easily to be changed; it was necessary
      for an author to take its prejudices into consideration&mdash;especially
      if he was young, and unknown, and&mdash;er&mdash;dependent upon his own
      resources. It seemed to Thyrsis, as he listened, that the great man must
      have arranged this luncheon as a stage-setting for his remarks&mdash;planning
      it on purpose to light a blaze of bitterness in the soul of the hungry
      poet. "Look at me," he seemed to say&mdash;"this is the way the job is
      done. Once I was poor and unknown like you&mdash;actually, though you
      might not credit it, a raw boy from the country. But I had taste and
      talent, and I was judicious; and so now for thirty years I have been at
      the head of one of the country's leading magazines. And see&mdash;by my
      mere word I am able to bring you here into the very citadel of power! For
      these men about you are the masters of the metropolis. There is a rich
      publisher&mdash;his name is a household word&mdash;and you saw how he
      touched me on the shoulder. There is an ex-mayor of the city&mdash;you saw
      how he nodded to me! Yonder is the head of one of the oldest and most
      exclusive of the city's landed families&mdash;even with him I am
      acquainted! And this is power! You may know it by all these signs of
      mahogany furniture, and leather upholstery, and waiters of reverential
      deportment. You may know it by the signs of respectability and awesomeness
      and chaste abundance. Make haste to pay homage to it, and enroll yourself
      in its service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis held himself in, and parted from the editor with all courtesy; but
      then, as he walked down Fifth Avenue, his fury burst into flame. Here,
      too, was power&mdash;here, too, the signs of it! Palaces of granite and
      marble, arid towering apartment-hotels; an endless vista of carriages and
      automobiles, with rich women lolling in them, or descending into shops
      whose windows blazed with jewels and silver and gold. Here were the
      masters of the metropolis, the masters of life; the dispensers of
      patronage&mdash;that "public" which he had to please. He would bring his
      vision and lay it at their feet, and they would give him or deny him
      opportunity! And what was it that they wanted? Was it worship and
      consecration and love? One could read the answer in their purse-proud
      glances; in the barriers of steel and bronze with which they protected the
      gates of their palaces; in the aspects of their flunkeys, whose casual
      glances were like blows in the face. One could read the answer in the
      pitiful features of the little errand-girl who went past, carrying some
      bit of their splendor to them; or of the ragged beggar, who hovered in the
      shelter of a side-street, fearing their displeasure. No, they were not
      lovers of life, and protectors; they were parasites and destroyers,
      devourers of the hopes of humanity! Their splendors were the distilled
      essence of the tears and agonies of millions of defeated people&mdash;their
      jewels were drops of blood from the heart of the human race!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. So, with rage and bitterness, Thyrsis was gnawing out his soul in
      the night-time; distilling those fierce poisons which he was to pour into
      the next of his works&mdash;the most terrible of them all, and the one
      which the world would never forgive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came another episode, to bring matters to a crisis. In the far
      Northwest lived another branch of Thyrsis' family, the head of which had
      become what the papers called a "lumber-king". One of this great man's
      radiant daughters was to be married, and the family made the selecting of
      her trousseau the occasion for a flying visit to the metropolis. So there
      were family reunions, and Thyrsis was invited to bring his wife and call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon voiced her perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they want to see <i>us</i> for?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I belong to their line," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;you are poor!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," he said, "but the family's the family, and they are too proud to
      be snobbish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;why do they ask me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis pondered. "They know we have published a book," he said. "It must
      be their tribute to literature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they people of culture?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless they've tried very hard," he answered. "But they have old
      traditions&mdash;and they want to be aristocratic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't go," said Corydon. "I couldn't stand them."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Thyrsis went alone&mdash;to that same temple of luxury where he had
      called upon the college-professor. And there he met the lumber-king, who
      was tall and imposing of aspect; and the lumber-queen, who was verging on
      stoutness; and the three lumber-princesses, who were disturbing creatures
      for a poet to gaze upon. It seemed to Thyrsis that he had been dwelling in
      the slums all his life&mdash;so sharp was the shock which came to him at
      the meeting with these young girls. They were exquisite beyond telling:
      the graceful lines of their figures, the perfect features, the radiant
      complexions; the soft, filmy gowns they wore, the faint, intoxicating
      perfumes that clung to them, the atmosphere of serenity which they
      radiated. There was that in Thyrsis which thrilled at their presence&mdash;he
      had been born into such a world, and might have had such a woman for his
      mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he put such thoughts from him&mdash;he had made his choice long ago,
      and it was not the primrose-path. Perhaps he was over-sensitive, acutely
      aware of himself as a strange creature with no cuffs, and with hardly any
      soles to his shoes. And all the time of these women was taken up by the
      arrival of packages of gowns and millinery; their conversation was of
      diamonds and automobiles, and the forthcoming honeymoon upon the Riviera.
      So it was hard for him not to feel bitterness; hard for him to keep his
      thoughts from going back to the lonely child-wife wandering about in the
      park&mdash;to all her deprivations, her blasted hopes and dying glories of
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family was going to the matinée; as there was room in their car, they
      asked Thyrsis to go with them. So he watched the lumber-king (who had
      refused to lend him money, but had offered him a "position") draw out a
      bank-note from a large roll, and pay for a box in one of Broadway's great
      palaces of art. And now&mdash;having been advised so often to study what
      the public wanted&mdash;now Thyrsis had a chance to recline at his ease
      and follow the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Princess of Prague", it was called; it was a "musical comedy"; and
      evidently exactly what the public wanted, for the house was crowded to the
      doors. The leading comedian was said by the papers to be receiving a
      salary of a thousand dollars a week. He held the center of the stage, clad
      in the costume of a lieutenant of marines, and winked and grinned, and
      performed antics, and sang songs of no doubtful significance, and emitted
      a fusillade of cynical jests. He was supposed to be half-drunk, and making
      love to a run-away princess&mdash;who would at one moment accept his
      caresses, and then spurn him coquettishly, and then execute an unlovely
      dance with him. In between these diverting procedures a chorus would come
      on, a score or so of highly-painted women, hopping and gliding about, each
      time clad in new costumes more cunningly indecent than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      From beginning to end of this piece there was not a single line of real
      humor, a spark of human sentiment, a gleam of intelligence; it was a kind
      of delirium tremens of the drama. To Thyrsis it seemed as if a whole
      civilization, with all its resources of science and art&mdash;its music
      and painting and costumes, its poets and composers, its actors, singers,
      orchestra, and audience&mdash;had all at once fallen victims to an attack
      of St. Vitus' dance. He sat and listened, while the theatre full of people
      roared and howled its applause; while the family beside him&mdash;mother
      and father and daughters&mdash;laughed over jokes that made him ashamed to
      turn and look at them. In the end the realization of what this scene meant&mdash;not
      only the break-down of a civilization, but the trap in which his own
      spirit was caught&mdash;made him sick and faint all over. He had to ask to
      be excused, and went out and sat in the lobby until the "show" was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family found him there, and the bride-to-be inquired if he "felt
      better"; then, looking at his pale face, an idea occurred to her, and
      after a bit of hesitation, she asked him if he would not stay to dinner.
      In her mind was the conflict between pity for this poor boy, and doubt as
      to the fitness of his costume; and Thyrsis, having read her mind in a
      flash, was divided between his humiliation, and his desire for some food.
      In the end the baser motive won; he buried his pride, and went to dinner.&mdash;And
      so, as the fates had planned it, the impulse to his next book was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. There came another guest to the meal&mdash;the rector of the
      fashionable church which the family attended at home. He was a young man,
      renowned for the charm of his oratory; smooth-shaven,
      pink-and-white-cheeked, exquisite in his manners, gracious and
      insinuating. His ideas and his language and his morals were all as
      perfectly polished as his finger-nails; and never before in his life had
      Thyrsis had such a red rag waved in his face. But he had come there for
      the dinner, and he attended to that, and let Dr. Holland provide the flow
      of soul; until at the very end, when the doctor was sipping his <i>demi-tasse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation had come, by some devious route, to Vegetarianism; and
      the clergyman was disapproving of it. That made no difference to Thyrsis,
      who was not a vegetarian, and knew nothing about it; but how he hated the
      arguments the man advanced! For that which made the doctor an
      anti-vegetarian was an attitude to life, which had also made him a
      Republican and an Imperialist, a graduate of Harvard and a beneficiary of
      the Apostolic Succession. Because life was a survival of the fittest, and
      because God had intended the less fit to take the doctor's word as their
      sentence of extermination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duty of animals, as the clergyman set it forth to them, was to convert
      plant-tissue into a more concentrated and perfect form of nutriment. "The
      protein of animal flesh," he was saying, "is more nearly allied to human
      tissue; and so it is clearly more fitted for our food."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Thyrsis entered the conversation. "Doctor Holland," he said, mildly,
      "I should think it would occur to you to follow your argument to its
      conclusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other turned to look at him. "What conclusion?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you would become a cannibal," Thyrsis replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was silence at the table. When Dr. Holland spoke again it
      was to hurry the conversation elsewhere; and from time to time thereafter
      he would steal a puzzled glance at Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this the boy did not see. His thoughts had gone whirling on; here, in
      this elegant dining-room, the throes of creation seized hold of him. For
      this was the image he had been seeking, the phrase that would embrace it
      all and express it all&mdash;the concentrated bitterness of his poisoned
      life! Yes, he had them! He had them, with all their glory and their power!
      They were Cannibals. <i>Cannibals</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when he set out from the hotel, he did not go home, but walked instead
      for uncounted hours in the park. And in those hours he lived through the
      whole of his new book, the unspeakable book&mdash;"The Higher
      Cannibalism"!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he told Corydon about it. She cried in terror, "But,
      Thyrsis, nobody would publish it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," she asked, "how can you write it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall write it," he said, "if I have to die when I get through". So he
      shut himself up in his room once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. A famous scientist began the story&mdash;reasoning along the
      lines of Dr. Holland's argument. The grass took the inorganic matter, and
      made it into food; the steer ate the grass, and carried it to the next
      stage; and beyond that was one stage more. So the scientist began making
      experiments&mdash;in a quiet way, of course. He reported the results
      before a learned scientific body, but his colleagues were so scandalized
      that the matter was hushed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seed had been sown, however. A younger man took up the idea, and made
      researches in the South Seas&mdash;substantiating the claim that those
      races which took to anthropophagy had invariably supplanted the others.
      The new investigator printed his findings in a book which was circulated
      privately; and pretty soon he was called into consultation by the
      master-mind of the country's finance&mdash;the richest man in the world.
      This man was old and bald and feeble; and now suddenly there came to him a
      new lease of life&mdash;new health and new enthusiasm. It was given out
      that he had got it by wandering about bare-footed in the grass, and
      playing golf all day&mdash;an explanation which the public accepted
      without question. No one remarked the fact that the old man began devoting
      his wealth to the establishing of foundling asylums; nor did any one think
      it suspicious that the younger generation of this multi-millionaire should
      rise so suddenly to power and fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there began to be strange rumors and suspicions. There were young
      writers, who had developed a new technique, and had carried poetic
      utterance to undreamed of heights; and in this poetry were cryptic
      allusions, hints of diabolic things. A Socialist paper printed the ménu of
      a banquet given by these "Neo-Nietzscheans", and demanded to know what one
      was to understand by <i>filet de mouton blanc</i>, and wherein lay the
      subtle humor of <i>paté de petit bête</i>. And at last the storm broke&mdash;a
      youth scarcely in his teens published a book of poems in which the dread
      secret was blazoned forth to the world with mocking defiance. There were
      frantic attempts to suppress this book, but they failed; and then a
      prosecuting officer, eager for notoriety, placed the youth upon trial for
      his life. And so the issue was drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public at large awakened to a dazed realization of the head-way which
      the new idea had made. It had become a cult of the ruling-class, the
      esoteric religion of the state; everywhere its defenders sprang up&mdash;it
      seemed as if all the intellectual as well as the material power of the
      community was under its spell. To oppose it was not merely bad form&mdash;it
      was to incur a stigma of moral inferiority, to be the victim of a
      "slave-ethic".
    </p>
    <p>
      With the scientific world, of course, its victory was speedy; the new
      doctrine was in line with recognized evolutionary teaching. The great
      names of Darwin and Spencer were invoked in its support; and, of course,
      when it came to economic science, there could be no two opinions. Had <i>laissez-faire</i>
      ever meant anything, if <i>laissez-faire</i> did not mean this?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very outset, the country was startled by the publication of a book
      by a college professor, famed as a leading sociologist, in which the case
      was presented without any attempt at sophistication. It was a fact,
      needing no attestation, that the mass of mankind had always lived in a
      state of slavery. At the present hour, under the forms of democracy, there
      were a quarter of a million men killed every year in industry, and half a
      million women living by prostitution, and two million children earning
      wages, and ten million people in want; and in comparison with these
      things, how humane was the new cult, how honest and above-board, how clean
      and economical! For the first time there could be offered to the submerged
      tenth a real social function to be performed. Once let the new teaching be
      applied upon a world-wide scale, and the proletariat might follow its
      natural impulse to multiply without limit; there would be no more
      "race-suicide" to trouble the souls of eminent statesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this at the time when the attention of the community was focussed upon
      the new <i>cause célèbre</i>! When the public prints were filled with an
      acrimonious discussion as to the meaning of the instructions given to the
      jury. If anyone chose to will his body to a purchaser, said the judge, and
      then go and commit suicide, there was no law to prevent him; and, of
      course, the subsequent purposes of the purchaser had nothing to do with
      the point at issue. This was a matter of taste&mdash;here the learned
      justice rapped for order&mdash;a matter of prejudice, largely, and the
      question at issue was one of law. There was no law controlling a man's
      dietetic idiosyncrasies, and it was to be doubted if constitutionally any
      such law would stand&mdash;certainly not in a federal court, unless it
      chanced to be a matter of interstate commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their bewilderment and dismay, the people turned to the Church. Surely
      the doctrines of Christianity would stand like a barricade against this
      monstrous cult. But already within the Church there had been rumors and
      disturbances; and now suddenly a bishop arose and voiced his protest
      against this attempt "to drag the Church into the mire of political
      controversy." It must be made perfectly clear, said the bishop, that
      Christianity was a religion, and not a dietetic dogma. Its purpose was to
      save the souls of men, and not to concern itself with their bodies. It had
      been stated that we should have the poor always with us; which made clear
      the futility of attempting to change the facts of Nature. Also it was
      certain that the founder of Christianity had been a meat-eater; and though
      there might be more than one interpretation placed upon his command
      concerning little children&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      There we might leave Thyrsis with the established Church. He had it just
      where he wanted it, and he shook it until its smoothly-shaven pink and
      white cheeks turned purple, and the <i>demi-tasse</i> went flying out of
      its beautifully manicured fingers! And while he did it he laughed aloud in
      hideous glee, and in his soul was a cry like the hunting-call of the lone
      gray wolf, that he had heard at midnight in his wilderness camp. So far a
      journey had come the little boy who had been dressed up in scarlet and
      purple robes, and had carried the bishop's train at the confirmation
      service! And so heavy a penalty did the church pay for its alliance with
      "good society"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Thyrsis paid a week's living expenses to have this manuscript
      copied; and then he took it about to the publishers. First came his friend
      Mr. Ardsley, who had become his chief adviser. When Thyrsis went to see
      him, Mr. Ardsley drew out an envelope from his desk, and took from it the
      opinion of his reader. "'What in the world is the matter with this boy?'"
      he read. "That's the opening sentence."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he fixed his eyes upon the boy. "What in the world <i>is</i> the
      matter?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sat silent; there was no reply he could make. He was strongly
      tempted to say to the man, "The matter is that I am not getting enough to
      eat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But already Thyrsis himself had judged "The Higher Cannibalism" and
      repudiated it. It was born of his pain and weakness, and it was not the
      work he had come into the world to do. So at the end he had placed a poem,
      which told of a visit from his muse, after the fashion of Musset's
      "Nuits"; the muse had been sad and silent, and in the end the poet had
      torn up the product of his hours of despair, and had renewed his faith
      with the gracious one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the long winter months dragged by, and still there was no gleam
      of hope. For Corydon it was even harder than for her husband. He at least
      was expressing his feelings, while she could only pine and chafe, without
      any sort of vent. Her life was a matter of colorless routine, in which
      each day was like the last, except in increased monotony. She tried hard
      not to let him see how she suffered; but sometimes the tears would come.
      And her unhappiness was bad for the child, which in the beginning had been
      robust and magnificent, but now was not growing properly. Thyrsis would
      have ridiculed the idea that nervousness could affect her milk; but the
      time came when, in later life, he saw the poisons of fatigue and fear in
      test-tubes, and so he understood why the child had not been able to lift
      its head until it was a year old, and had then been well on the way to
      having "rickets."
    </p>
    <p>
      All their life was so different from the way they had dreamed it! The
      dream still lured them; but its voice grew fainter and more remote. How
      were they to keep it real to themselves, how were they to hold it? Their
      existence was made up of endless sordidness, of dreary commonplace, that
      opposed them with its passive inertia where it did not actively attack
      them. "Ah, Thyrsis!" Corydon would cry to him, "this will kill us if it
      lasts too long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing, they no longer heard any music at all&mdash;She was not
      strong enough to practice the piano; and his violin was gone. Here in the
      great city an endless stream of concerts and operas and recitals flowed
      past; and here were they, like starving children who press their faces
      against a pastry-cook's window and devour the sweets with their eyes.
      Thyrsis kept up with musical and dramatic progress by reading the accounts
      in the papers and magazines; but this was a good deal like slaking one's
      thirst with a mirage. He used to wonder sometimes if he were to write to
      these great artists&mdash;would they invite him to hear them, or would
      they too despise him? He never had the courage to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the course of the long winter some one presented Corydon with two
      tickets to the opera, and they went together, in a state of utter bliss.
      It was an unusual experience for Thyrsis, for their seats were in the
      orchestra, and hitherto he had always heard his operas from the upper rows
      in the fifth balcony, where the air was hot and stifling, and the singers
      appeared as a pair of tiny arms that waved, and a head (frequently a bald
      head) that emitted a thin, far-distant voice. This had become to him one
      of the conventions of the opera; and now to discover the singers as
      full-sized human beings, with faces and legs and loud voices, was very
      disturbing to his sense of illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, alas, they had not been free to select the opera. It was "La
      Traviata"; and there was not much food for their hungry souls in this
      farrago of artificiality and sham sentiment. They shut their eyes and
      tried to enjoy the music, forgetting the gallant young men of fashion and
      their fascinating mistresses. But even the music, it seemed, was tainted;
      or could it be, Thyrsis wondered, that he could no longer lose himself in
      the pure joy of melody? Many kinds of corruption he had by this time
      learned about; the corruption of men, and of women, and of children; the
      corruption of painting and sculpture, of poetry and the drama. But the
      corruption of music was something which even yet he could not face; for
      music was the very voice of the soul&mdash;the well-spring from which life
      itself was derived. Thyrsis thought, as he and Corydon wandered about in
      the foyers of this palatial opera-house, was there anywhere on earth a
      place in which heaven and hell came so close together. A place where the
      lust and pride of the flesh displayed themselves in all their glory; and
      in contrast with the purest ecstasies the human spirit had attained! He
      pointed out one rich dowager who swept past them; her breasts all but
      jostling out of her corsage as she walked, her stomach squeezed into a
      sort of armor-plate of jewels, her cheeks powdered and painted, her head
      weighted with false hair and a tiara of diamonds, her face like a mask of
      pride and scorn. And then, in juxtaposition with that, the <i>Waldweben</i>
      and the <i>Feuerzauber</i>, or the grim and awful tragedy of the Siegfried
      funeral-march! There were people in this opera-house who knew what such
      music meant; Thyrsis had read it in their faces, in that suffocating
      top-gallery. He wondered if some day the demons that were evoked by the
      music might not call to them and lead them in revolt, to drive the
      money-changers from the temple once again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Another editor was reading "The Hearer of Truth," and a publisher
      was hovering on the brink of venturing "The Higher Cannibalism"; and so
      the two had new hopes to lure them on. When the spring-time had come, they
      would once more escape from the city, and would put up their tent on the
      lake-shore! They spent long afternoons picturing just how they would live&mdash;what
      they would eat, and what they would wear, and what they would study. As
      for Cedric&mdash;so they had called the baby&mdash;they saw him playing
      beneath the big tree in front of the tent. And what fun they would have
      giving him his bath on the little beach inside the point!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll fix up a clothes-basket for him to sleep in!" declared Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, dear!" said Corydon. "I've told you many times before&mdash;we'll
      <i>have</i> to have a crib for him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?" cried he; and there would follow an argument which gave pain to
      his economical soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon declared herself willing to do her share in the matter of saving
      money; but it seemed to him that whenever he suggested a concrete idea,
      there would be objections. "We can get up at dawn," he would say, "and
      save the cost of oil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she would answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we can do our own laundry," he would continue. But immediately
      another argument would begin; it was impossible to persuade Corydon that
      diapers could be washed in cold water, even when one had the whole of the
      Great Lakes for a washtub.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would go on to contemplate the glorious time when they would have
      money enough to build a home of their own, that could be inhabited in
      winter as well as in summer; Corydon always referred to it with the line
      from "Caradrion"&mdash;"the little cot, fringed round with tender green."
      It would be fine for the baby, they agreed&mdash;he should never have to
      go back to the city again. Thyrsis had a vision of him as he would be in
      that home: a brown and freckled country boy, with what were known, in the
      dialect of "dam-fool talk", as "yagged panties and bare feets".
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corydon would protest at that picture. "It's all right," she said, "to
      put up with ugliness if you have to. But what's the use of making a fetish
      of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wouldn't be ugliness," replied he. "It would be Nature! 'Blessings on
      thee, little man!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all very well. But I want Cedric to have curls&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curls!" he cried. "And then a Fauntleroy suit, I suppose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;at least not while we're poor. But I want him to look decent&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have curls, then you'll want a nurse-maid to brush them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Thyrsis! Can't a mother take care of her child's own hair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Some</i> mothers can&mdash;they have nothing better to do. But if you
      were going in for the hair-dresser's art, why did you cut off your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so would come yet new discussions. "You'll be wanting me to maintain
      an establishment!" Thyrsis would cry, whenever these aesthetic impulses
      manifested themselves. He seemed to be haunted by that image of an
      establishment. All married men came to it in the end&mdash;there seemed to
      be something in matrimony that predisposed to it; and far better adopt at
      once the ideals and habits of the gypsies, than to settle into
      respectability with a nurse-maid and a cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was under the necessity of sweeping clean his soul, because of all
      the luxury and wantonness he saw in this metropolis, and the madness to
      which it goaded his soul. Some day fame would come to him, he knew&mdash;wealth
      also, perhaps; and oh, there must be one man in all the city who was not
      corrupted, who did not learn extravagance and self-indulgence, who
      practiced as well as preached the life of faith! And so, again and again,
      he and Corydon would renew the pledges of their courtship-days&mdash;pledges
      to a discipline of Spartan sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor as he was, Thyrsis still found time to figure over the things he
      meant to do when he got money: the publishing-house that was to bring out
      his books at cost, and the free reading-rooms and the circulating
      libraries. Also, he wanted to edit a magazine; for there was a great truth
      which he wished to teach the world. "We must make these things that we
      have suffered count for something!" he would say to Corydon, again and
      again. "We must use them to open people's eyes!" He was thinking how, when
      at last he had escaped from the pit, he would be in a position to speak
      for those others who were left behind. Men would heed him then, and he
      could show them how impossible it was for the creative artist to do his
      work, and at the same time carry on the struggle for bread. He would
      induce some rich man to set aside a fund for the endowment of young
      writers; and so the man who had a real message might no longer have to
      starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had by this time tried all the world, and he knew that there was
      no one to understand. Just about now he was utterly stranded, and had to
      borrow money for even his next day's food. And oh, the humiliations and
      insults that came with these loans! And worse yet, the humiliations and
      insults that came without any loans! There was one rich man who advanced
      him ten dollars; Thyrsis, when he returned it, sent a check he had
      received from some out-of-town magazine&mdash;and in return was rebuked by
      the rich man for failing to include the "exchange" on the check. Thyrsis
      wrote humbly to inquire what manner of thing the "exchange" on a check
      might be; and learned that he was still in the rich man's debt to the sum
      of ten cents!
    </p>
    <p>
      His case was the more hopeless, he found, because he was a married man.
      The world might have pardoned a young free-lance who was willing to "rough
      it" and take his chances for a while; but a man who had a wife and child&mdash;and
      was still prating about poetry! To the world the possession of a wife and
      child meant self-indulgence; and when a man had fallen into that trap, he
      simply had to settle down and take the consequence. How could Thyrsis
      explain that his marriage had not been as other men's? How could he hint
      at such a thing, without proving himself a cad?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. The work of "contemporary biography" had come to an end; there
      followed weeks of seeking, and then another opening appeared&mdash;Mr.
      Ardsley offered him a chance to do some manuscript-reading. This was
      really a splendid opportunity, for the work would not be difficult, and
      the payment would be five dollars for each manuscript. Thyrsis accepted
      joyfully, and forthwith carried off a couple of embryo books to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new and curious occupation, which opened up to him whole worlds
      whose existence he had not previously suspected. Through his
      review-writing he had become acquainted with the books that had seen the
      light of day; now he made the startling discovery that for every one that
      was born, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, that died in the womb.
      He could see how it went&mdash;the hordes of half-educated people who read
      books and were moved to write something like them. Each manuscript was a
      separate tragedy; and often there would be a letter or a preface to make
      certain that one did not miss the sense of it. Here would be a
      settlement-worker, burning with a message, but unable to draw a character
      or to write dialogue; here would be a business-man, who had studied up the
      dialect of the region where he spent his summer vacations, and whose style
      was so crude that one winced as he turned the pages; here would be a poor
      bookkeeper, or a type-writer, or other cog in the business machine, who
      had read of the fortunes made by writers of fiction, and had spent all his
      hours of leisure for a year in composing a tale of the <i>grand monde</i>,
      or some feeble imitation of the sugar-coated "historical romance" of the
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes as he read these manuscripts, a shudder would come over Thyrsis;
      how they made him realize the odds in the game of life! These thousands
      and tens of thousands panting and striving for success; and he lost in the
      throng of them! What madness it seemed to imagine that he might climb over
      their heads&mdash;that he had been chosen to scale the heights of fame!
      Their letters and prefaces sounded like a satire upon his own attitude, a
      <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of his claims to "genius". Here, for instance,
      was a man who wrote to introduce himself as America's first epic poet&mdash;stating
      incidentally that he was an inspector of gas-meters, and had a wife and
      six children. His poem occupied some six hundred foolscap sheets, finely
      bound up by hand; it set forth the soul-states of a Byron from Alabama&mdash;an
      aristocratic hero who was refused by the lady of his heart, and voiced his
      anger and perplexity in a long speech, two lines of which stamped
      themselves forever upon the mind of the reader&mdash;-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "But I! he cried. My limbs are straight,
    My purse well-filled, my veins all F. F. V.!"
</pre>
    <p>
      As a method of earning one's living, this was almost too good to be true.
      The worse the manuscripts were the easier was his task; in fact, when he
      came upon one which showed traces of real power and interest he cursed his
      fate, for then it might take several days to earn his five dollars. But
      for the most part the manuscripts were bad enough, and he could have
      earned a year's income in a week, if only there had been enough of them.
      So he made a great effort to succeed at the work, and filled his reports
      with epigrams and keen observations, carefully adapted to what he knew was
      Mr. Ardsley's point of view. He allowed time for these devices to be
      effective, and then paid a visit to find out about the prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ardsley," he began, "I am going to try to meet you half way with a
      book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to write a novel that you can publish. I believe that I can do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ardsley warmed immediately. "I have always been certain that you
      could," said he. He went on to expound to Thyrsis the ethics of
      opportunism&mdash;how it would not be necessary to be false to his
      convictions, to write anything that he did not believe&mdash;but simply to
      put his convictions into a popular form, and to impart no more than the
      public could swallow at the first mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis told him the outline of a plot. He would write a story of the
      struggles of a young author in the metropolis&mdash;not such a young
      author as himself, a rebel and a frenzied egotist, but a plain, everyday
      young author whom other people could care about. He had the "local color"
      for such a tale, and he could do it without too much waste of time. Mr.
      Ardsley thought it an excellent idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which Thyrsis came, very cautiously, to the meat of the matter. "I
      want to get away into the country to write it," he said; "and so I wanted
      to ask you about the manuscripts you are sending me. Have you found my
      work satisfactory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think you can send them through the summer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I presume so. It depends upon how many come to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you couldn't arrange to let me have any more of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at present," said Mr. Ardsley. "You see, I have regular readers,
      whose work I know. I'll send you what I have to spare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Thyrsis. "I'll be glad to have all you can give me."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went away; and in the little room he and Corydon had an anxious
      consultation. He had been getting about twenty dollars a month; which was
      not enough for the family to exist upon. "Our only hope is a new book," he
      declared; and Corydon saw that was the truth. "Each week that I stay here
      is a loss," he added. "I have to pay room-rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you stand tenting out in April?" asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll chance it," he replied&mdash;"if you'll say the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that her duty was before her; she must nerve herself and face it,
      though it tore her heartstrings. She must stay and take care of the baby,
      while he went away to work!
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and held her hands, and saw her bite her lips and fight to keep
      back the tears in her eyes. Their hearts had grown together, so that it
      was like tearing their flesh to separate them. They had never imagined
      that such a thing could come into their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she whispered&mdash;"you'll forget me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hands more tightly. "No, dear! No!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll get used to living without me!" she cried. "And it's the time
      in my life when I need you most!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will stay, dearest, if you say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      She exclaimed, "No, no! I must stand it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And seeing her grief, his heart breaking with pity, a strange impulse came
      to Thyrsis. He took her hands in his, and knelt down before her, and began
      to pray. It had been years since he had thought of prayer, and Corydon had
      never thought of it in her life. It came from the deeps of him&mdash;a few
      stammering words, simple, almost childish, yet exquisite as music. He
      prayed that they might have courage to keep up the fight, that they might
      be able to hold their love before them, that nothing might ever dim their
      vision of each other. It was a prayer without theology or metaphysics&mdash;a
      prayer to the unknown gods; but it set free the well-spring of tenderness
      and pity within them; and when he finished Corydon was sobbing upon his
      shoulder.

      BOOK IX. THE CAPTIVE IN LEASH
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>They were standing on the hill-top, watching the last glimmer of the
      sinking moon. As the faint perfume of the clover came to them upon the
      warm evening wind, she sighed, and whispered&mdash; </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!
        'Mid city noise, not as with thee of yore,
            Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home!"
</pre>
    <p>
      She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," he said, and she quoted&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying roar,
    Let in thy voice a whisper always come,
        To chase fatigue and fear:
    Why faintest thou? I wandered till I died.
        Roam on! The light we sought is shining still."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. Thyrsis made his plans and packed his few belongings. There came
      another pass from the "higher regions", and he took the night-train once
      more, and came to the little town upon the shores of Lake Ontario. Once
      more the sun shone on the crystal-green water, and the cold breeze blew
      from off the lake. There was still snow in the ravines of the deep woods,
      but Thyrsis got his tent out of the farmer's barn, and patched up the
      holes the mice had gnawed, and put it up on the old familiar spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange to him to be there without Corydon. There were so many
      things to remind him of her&mdash;a sudden memory would catch him
      unawares, and stab him like a knife. There was the rocky headland where
      they had swam, and there was the pine-tree that the lightning had
      splintered, one day while they were standing near. When darkness came, and
      he was unpacking a few old things that they had left up in the country,
      his loneliness seemed to him almost more than he could bear; he sat by the
      little stove, holding a pair of her old faded slippers in his hands, and
      felt his tears trickling down upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it took him only a day or two to drive such things out of his mind.
      There was no time for sentiment now&mdash;it was "Clear ship for action!"
      For once in his life he was free, and had a chance to work. He was full of
      his talk with Mr. Ardsley, and meant to do his best to be "practical." And
      so behold him wandering about in the water-soaked forests, or tramping the
      muddy roads, or sitting by his little stove while the cold storms beat
      upon the tent&mdash;wrestling with his unruly Pegasus, and dragging it
      back a hundred times a day to what was proper, and human, and interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbors had warned him that it was too early for tenting, but
      Thyrsis had vowed he would stand it. And now, as if to punish him for his
      defiance, there was emptied out upon him the cave of all the winds; for
      four weeks there were such storms of rain and sleet and snow as the region
      had never known in April. There were nights when he sat wrapped in
      overcoats and blankets, with a fire in the stove; and still shivering for
      the gale that drove through the canvas. There came one calm, starlit night
      when he lay for hours almost frozen, and sat up in the morning to find a
      glass of water at his bedside frozen solid. Thirteen degrees the
      thermometer showed, according to the farmer; and oh, the agony of getting
      out of bed, and starting a fire with green wood! In the end Thyrsis poured
      in half a can of kerosene, and got the stove red-hot; and then he turned
      round to warm his back, and smelled smoke, and whirled about to find his
      tent in a blaze!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bucket of water and a broomstick he beat out the fire, and went for
      a run to warm up. But when he came back there was more wind, so that he
      could not keep warm in the tent, and more rain, so that he could not find
      shelter in the woods. In the end he discovered a ruined barn, in a corner
      of which he would sit, wrapped in his blankets and writing with cold
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps all these mishaps had something to do with the refusal of his
      ideas to flow. But apparently it was in vain that Thyrsis tried at any
      time to work at things that were interesting to other people. Perhaps he
      could have worked better at them, if there had not been so many things
      that were interesting to <i>him</i>. He would find himself confronted with
      the image of the society clergyman, or of the sleek editor in his club, or
      some other memory out of the world of luxury and pride. And each day came
      the newspaper, with its burden of callousness and scorn; and perhaps also
      a letter from Corydon, with something to goad him to new tilts with the
      enemies of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, before long, almost without realizing it, he was putting the
      "interesting" things aside, and girding himself for another battle. His
      message was still undelivered; and in vain he sought to content himself by
      blaming the world for this. Until he had forced the world to hear him, he
      had simply not yet done his work. He must take his thought and shape it
      anew&mdash;into some art-work finer, stronger, truer than he had yet
      achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day he pondered this idea&mdash;eating with it and walking with
      it and sleeping with it; until at last, of a sudden, the vision came to
      him. It came late at night, while he was undressing; and he sat for five
      or ten minutes, with his shirt half off, as if in a trance. Then he put
      the shirt on again, and went out to wander about the woods, laughing and
      talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Genius surrounded by Commercialism"&mdash;that was his theme; and it
      would have to be a play. Its hero would be a young musician, a mere boy, a
      master of the demon-voices of the violin; he would be rapt in his vision,
      and around him a group of people who would be embodiments of the world and
      all its forces of evil. One by one they came trooping before Thyrsis'
      fancy, with all their trappings of pomp and power, their greatness and
      their greed&mdash;sinister and cruel figures, but also humorous, very
      creatures of the spirit of comedy! Yes, he had a comedy this time&mdash;a
      real comedy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. In this hour, of course, Thyrsis forgot all about the "plot" he
      had outlined to Mr. Ardsley, and about his promises to be "practical."
      Something arose within him, imperious and majestic, and swept all this out
      of the way with one gesture of the hand. He dropped everything else and
      plunged into the play. Never yet in his life had anything taken hold of
      him to such an extent; it drove him so that he forgot to eat, he forgot to
      sleep. He would work over some part of it until he was exhausted&mdash;and
      then, without warning, some other part would open out in a vista before
      him, and he would spring up in pursuit of that. Characters and episodes
      and dialogue, wild humor, scalding satire, grim tragedy&mdash;they
      thronged and jostled and crowded one another in his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Genius" was the title of the play. Its protagonist had come home
      after completing his education in Vienna; and there was the family
      gathered to greet him. Mr. Hartman, the father, was a wholesale grocer&mdash;a
      business large enough to have brought wealth, but painfully tainted with
      "commonness". Then there was Mrs. Hartman, stout and tightly-laced, who
      had studied the science of elegance while her husband studied sugar. There
      was the elder son, who under his mother's guidance had married well; and
      Miss Violet Hartman, who was looking up to the perilous heights of a
      foreign alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only of late had the family come to realize what an asset to their career
      this "Genius" might be. They had humored him in his strange whim to devote
      his life to fiddling; money had been spent on him freely&mdash;he brought
      home with him a famous Cremona instrument for which three thousand dollars
      had been paid. But now it was dawning upon them that this was an "ugly
      duckling"; he was to make his <i>début</i> in the metropolis, where an
      overwhelming triumph was expected; and then he would return to the home
      city in the middle West, and would play at <i>musicales</i>, which even
      the most exclusive of the "<i>élite</i>" must attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also the great Prof. Reminitsky, the teacher who had made Lloyd,
      and had come to New York with him; and there was the Herr Prof. von Arne,
      of the University of Berlin, a world-renowned psychiatrist, author of "The
      Neurosis of Inspiration". The Herr Professor had come to America to make
      some studies for his forthcoming masterpiece on the religious mania; and
      he was glad to see his old friend Reminitsky, whose seventeen-year-old
      musical prodigy was most interesting material for study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prof. Reminitsky was the world's greatest authority in the art of tearing
      the human soul to pieces by means of horse-hair rubbed with resin and
      scraped over the intestines of a pig. There were no tricks of
      finger-gymnastics and of tone-production that he had not mastered. As for
      the emotions produced thereby, he felt them, but in a purely professional
      way; that is, the convictions he had concerning them related to their
      effects upon audiences, and more especially upon the score or two of
      critical experts whose psychology had been his life-study. But having
      studied also the psychology of youth, he knew that his <i>protégé</i> must
      needs have other convictions concerning his performances. This was his
      supreme greatness&mdash;that he understood the paranoia of enthusiasm, and
      used this understanding to tempt his pupils to new heights of achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all of which, of course, his friend von Arne was a great help to him.
      Von Arne had dug through a score of great libraries, and had travelled all
      the world over, frequenting cafes and salons, monasteries and
      prayer-cells, prisons and hospitals and asylums&mdash;wherever one might
      get new glimpses of the extraordinarily intricate phenomena of the
      aberration called "Genius". He had several thousand cases of it at his
      finger-tips&mdash;he had measured its reaction-times and calculated its
      cephalic index, and analyzed its secretions and tested it for indecan. He
      knew trance and clairvoyance, auto-suggestion and telepathic
      hallucination, epilepsy and hysteria and ecstasy; and over the head of any
      disputatious person he would swing the steam-shovel of his erudition, and
      bury the unfortunate beneath a wagon-load of Latin and Greek derivatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there was Moses Rosen, the business-manager. Moses was short, and
      wore a large diamond ring, and he also was a specialist in the phenomena
      of "Genius". He studied them from the point of view of the box-office, and
      his tests were quite as definite as those of the psychological laboratory.
      There came to Moses an endless stream of prodigies, all of them having
      long hair and picturesque aspects, and talking rapidly and rolling their
      eyes; the problem was to determine which of them had the faculty of true
      Genius, which not only talked rapidly and rolled its eyes, but also had
      the power of causing money to flow in through a box-office window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case Moses felt that the prospects were good; the only trouble
      being that the prodigy intended to render a <i>concerto</i> by a strange
      composer&mdash;a stormy and unconventional thing which would annoy the
      critics. Moses suggested something that was "classic"; and agreed with
      Mrs. Hartman that there ought to be something corresponding to "good form"
      in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. So all these strange creatures were poking and peering and
      smelling about the "Genius"; and meanwhile, there came at intervals faint
      strains of music from a distant room. At last Lloyd Hartman entered;
      beautiful, pale and sensitive&mdash;a haunted boy, and the most haunting
      figure that had yet come to Thyrsis' imagination. Also, it was the hardest
      piece of work he had ever undertaken; for the character had come to him,
      not as a formula or a collection of phrases, but as an intuition, a part
      of his own soul; and he would work out a scene a score of times, finding
      words to phrase it, and then rejecting them. By what speeches could he
      give his sense of the gulf that lay between Lloyd and the people about
      him? For this boy could not cope with them in argument, he would have no
      mastery of the world of facts. He must be without any touch of
      sophistication, of cynicism; and yet, when he spoke to them, it must be
      clear that he knew them for different beings from himself. He would go
      with them meekly; but one would feel that it was because his path lay in
      their direction. When the point came that their ways parted, he would go
      his own way; and just there lay the seed of the tragi-comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family gathers about him, and he answers their questions. He will wear
      the kind of tie that his sister prefers, and they may set any date they
      please for the <i>musicales</i> at home. He hears the "copy" which Moses
      has prepared for his advertisements; and then he sits, absent-minded,
      while they talk about him. Music is in his thoughts, and gradually it
      steals into his aspect and the gestures of his hand. They watch him, and a
      pall comes over them: until at last the mother exclaims that he makes her
      nervous, and leads the family off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Arnold is announced&mdash;Helena Arnold, who has been
      recommended as accompanist at the great concert. She is young and
      beautiful; and the two go into the next room to play, while the professors
      remain to talk over this new complication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prof. von Arne, of course, lays especial emphasis upon the sex-element in
      psychopathology; he and Reminitsky have talked the subject out many years
      ago, and adopted a definite course of action. The abnormalities incidental
      to sex-repression were innumerable, and for the most part destructive; but
      there could be no question that all the more striking phenomena of the
      neurosis called "Genius" were greatly increased in their intensity by this
      means. So, in dealing with his pupils, and especially with a prodigy like
      young Hartman, Prof. Reminitsky would call into service all the
      paraphernalia of religious mysticism; teaching his pupil to regard woman
      as the object of exalted adoration, a being too holy to be attained to
      even in thought. And now, of course, when the proposed accompanist turns
      out to be a decidedly alluring young female, it is necessary to take
      careful heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile from the distance come bursts of wild music; and at last Helena
      returns&mdash;pale, and deeply agitated. "It is that <i>concerto!</i>" she
      says, and then asks to be excused from talking. Lloyd comes, and stands by
      the door watching her. When his teacher begins to open business
      negotiations, he asks him abruptly to leave them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena asks, "Who wrote that music?" He tells her a ghastly story of a
      titan soul who starved in a garret and shot himself, crushed by the
      mockery of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have saved him!" the boy exclaims. "I was so busy with the music
      I forgot the man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They talk about this epoch-making <i>concerto</i>, and how Lloyd means to
      force it upon the public. "And you shall play it with me!" he exclaims.
      "You are the first that has ever understood it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot play it!" she protests; to which he answers, "It was like his
      voice come back from the grave!" And so we see these two souls cast into
      the crucible together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. The second act showed the aftermath of the great concert, and
      took place in the drawing-room of the Hartman family's apartment, at four
      o'clock in the morning. We see Moses and the two professors, who have not
      been able to tear themselves away; dishevelled, <i>distrait</i>, wild with
      vexation, they pace about and lament. Failure, utter ruin confronts them&mdash;the
      structure of their hopes lies in the dust! They blame it all on "that
      woman"&mdash;and members of the family concur in this. It was she who kept
      Lloyd to his resolve to play that mad <i>concerto;</i> and then, to cast
      aside all the master had taught them, all the results of weeks of drilling&mdash;and
      to play it in that frantic, demonic fashion. Now the men await the morning
      papers, which will bring them the verdict of "the world"; and they shudder
      with the foreknowledge of what that verdict will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lloyd and Helena enter. They have been walking for hours, and have not
      been thinking of "the world". They listen, half-heeding, to the protests
      and laments; they could not help it, they explain&mdash;the music took
      hold of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two professors go off to get the papers, and Moses goes into the next
      room to rest; after which it becomes clear to the audience that Lloyd and
      Helena are fighting the sex-duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not care about people," she is saying, sombrely.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which his reply is, "It is not to be found in people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet from people it must come!" she insists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answers, "They do not even know what I mean; and they have no
      humility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a problem," Lloyd continues, after a pause. "Shall one go on alone,
      or wait and bring others with him?&mdash;You have brought that problem
      into my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answers to this, "I cannot see how my love will hinder you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replies, "If you love <i>me</i>, who will love my art?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So it goes&mdash;until the professors return with their freight of the
      world's Philistinism. And here came a scene, over which Thyrsis shook for
      many a day with merriment. The accounts of the concert are read; Moses
      awakens and comes in; and as the agony increases, the members of the
      family appear, one by one, clad in their dressing-gowns, and adding their
      lamentations to the chorus. Gone is all the prestige of the two
      professors, gone all the profits of Moses, gone all the visions of social
      triumphs in the city of the middle West!
    </p>
    <p>
      To all of which uproar the two listen patiently; until at last the mother,
      in a transport of vexation, turns upon Helena, and accuses her of
      ensnaring the boy. And then&mdash;the climax of the scene&mdash;Lloyd
      springs up; all that Genius in him, which has so far gone into music,
      turns now into rage and scorn. He pictures these people&mdash;pawing over
      his inspiration with their unclean hands&mdash;peering at it, weighing it,
      chaffering over it&mdash;taking it into the market-place to be hawked
      about. He shows them what they are, and what that "world" is, to which
      they would offer his muse as a whore. And then at the climax of his
      speech, as he is waving his violin in the air, the Herr Prof. von Arne
      ventures to put in a word; and the boy whirls upon him, and brings down
      the three thousand-dollar treasure upon the eminent psychiatrist's head!
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act, which was the hardest of all to write, was to take place in
      a garret. Lloyd has gone away alone, and three years have passed, and now
      he lies dying of a wasting disease. Helena has come to him again&mdash;and
      still they are fighting the duel. "A woman will do anything for a man but
      renounce him," says Lloyd; and she cannot understand this fierce instinct
      of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has come and found him; and he lies gasping for breath, and speaking
      in broken sentences. Yet he will not have her bring grief into his
      chamber; he has fought his way through grief, and through hatred and
      contempt, and now he lies at peace upon the bosom of nature. No longer is
      he wrapped up in his own vision; he has learned from the million suns in
      the sky and the million trees of the forest. He tells her that the thing
      called "Genius" springs ceaselessly from the heart of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has cast out fear; and with it he has cast out love. "What are you?" he
      asks. "What am I?" And he sets forth in blazing words his vision of the
      soul, which is as a flash of light in a raindrop, and yet one with the
      eternal process. As the fruit of his life he leaves one symphony in
      manuscript, and some pages of writing in which he has summed up his faith.
      That is enough, he says&mdash;that is victory; for that he fled away, and
      killed his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two professors come, having learned that Lloyd is dying. But even they
      cannot divert him. He tells von Arne that his learning will submit itself,
      and that scientists will be as gardeners, tending the young flowers of
      faith. His mother and father come, and he whispers that even for them
      there is hope&mdash;that in the deepest mire of respectability the spark
      of the soul still glows. His mother bursts into weeping by his bed, and he
      tells her that even from the dungeon of pride there may be deliverance. So
      he sends them all away to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Helena sits at the piano and plays a few bars of that sonata of
      Beethoven's which is an utterance of most poignant grief, and which some
      publisher has cruelly misnamed the "Moonlight". And after long silence,
      the dying man communes with his muse. A light suffuses the room, and he
      whispers, "Take thine own time; for the seeds of thy glories are planted
      in the hearts of men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. Over these things Thyrsis would work for six hours at a stretch,
      sitting without moving a muscle; for days and nights he would wander about
      at random in the woods. He ate irregularly, of such things as he could put
      his hands upon; and sleep fled from him like a mistress spurned. When,
      after a couple of months, he had finished the task, there was an incessant
      throbbing in his forehead, and&mdash;alas for the sudden tumble from the
      heights of Parnassus!&mdash;he had lost almost entirely the power of
      digesting food.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the play was done. He sent it off to be copied, and wrote paeans of
      thanksgiving to Corydon. Once more he had a weapon, newly-forged and
      sharpened, wherewith to pierce that tough hide of the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained the practical question: What did one do when he had a play
      completed? What was the first step to be taken? Thyrsis pondered the
      problem for several days; and then, as chance would have it, his eye was
      caught by a newspaper paragraph to the effect that "Ethelynda Lewis, the
      popular <i>comédienne</i>, is to be starred in a serious drama next
      season, under the management of Robertson Jones. Miss Lewis's play has not
      yet been selected." Now, as it happened, "Ethelynda Lewis" had been on the
      play-bill of "The Princess of Prague", that tragic "musical comedy" to
      which Thyrsis had been taken; but he never noticed the names of actors and
      actresses, and had no suspicions. He sent his manuscript to this future
      star; and a week later came a note, written on scented monogram paper in a
      tall and distinguished chirography, acknowledging the receipt of his play
      and promising to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyrsis turned to attack the manuscripts which had been accumulating
      while he was writing. They were coming more frequently now&mdash;apparently
      Mr. Ardsley liked his work. To Corydon, who had gone to the country with
      her parents, he wrote that he was getting some money ahead, and so she
      might join him before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought him a deluge of letters; and it forced him to another swift
      descent into the world of reality. "I have told you nothing of my
      sufferings," wrote Corydon. "At least a score of times I have written you
      long letters and then torn them up, saying that your work must not be
      disturbed. But oh, Thyrsis, I do not think I can stand it much longer! Can
      you imagine what it means to be shut up in a boarding-house, without one
      living soul to understand about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go on to tell of her griefs and humiliations, her longings and
      rages and despairs. Then, too, Cedric was not growing as he should. "He is
      beautiful," she wrote, "and every one loves him. But he makes not the
      least attempt to sit up, and I am very much worried. I fear that I ought
      not to go on nursing him&mdash;I am too nervous to eat as I should. And
      then I think of the winter, and that we may still be separated, and I do
      not see how I am to stand it. It is as if I were in a prison. I think of
      you, and I cannot make you real to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      To all of which Thyrsis could only reply with vague hopes&mdash;and then
      go away for a tramp in the forest, and call to his soul for new courage.
      He had still troubles enough of his own. For one thing, the fiend in his
      stomach was not to be exorcised by any spell he knew. It was all very
      picturesque to portray one's hero as dying of disease; but in reality it
      was not at all satisfactory. Thyrsis did not die, he merely ate a bowl of
      bread and milk, and then went about for several hours, feeling as if there
      were a football blown up inside of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a touching faith in the medical profession in those days, and
      whenever there was anything wrong with him, he would turn the problem over
      to a doctor and his soul would be at rest. In this case the doctor told
      him that he had dyspepsia&mdash;not a very difficult diagnosis&mdash;and
      gave him a bottle full of a red liquid to be taken after meals. To Thyrsis
      this seemed an example of the marvels of science, of the adjustment of
      means to ends; for behold, when he had taken the red liquid, the bread and
      milk disappeared as if by magic! And he might go on and eat anything else&mdash;if
      there was trouble, he had only to take more of the red liquid! So he
      plunged into work on a pot-boiler, and wrote Corydon to be of cheer, that
      the dawn was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. Corydon, in the meantime, had received a copy of his play; and he
      was surprised at the effect it had upon her. "It is marvellous," she
      wrote; "it is like a blaze of lightning from one end to the other. And
      yet, much as I rejoice in its power, the main feeling it brought me was of
      anguish; for it seemed to me as if in this play you had spoken out of your
      inmost soul. Can it be that you are really chafing against the bond of our
      love? That you feel that I have hold of you and cling to you; and that you
      resent it, and shrink from me? Oh Thyrsis, what can I do? Shall I bid you
      go, and blot the thought of you from my mind? Is that what you truly want?
      'A woman will do anything for a man but renounce him!' Did you not shudder
      for me when you wrote those words?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is two o'clock in the morning, and so far I have not been able to
      sleep. I have lain awake with torturing thoughts; and then the baby
      wakened up, and I had to put him to sleep again&mdash;any indisposition of
      mine always affects him. I am sitting on the floor at the foot of the bed,
      writing with a candle; and hoping to get myself sufficiently exhausted, so
      that I shall no longer lie awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and find your vision over my corpse, and may God bless you!... I wrote
      that hours ago, and I tried to mean it. I try to tell myself that I will
      take the child and go away, and crush my own hopes and yearnings, and give
      my life to him. But no&mdash;I cannot, I cannot! It is perfectly futile
      for me to think of that&mdash;I crave for life, and I cannot give up.
      There is that in me that will never yield, that will take no refusal.
      Sometimes I see myself as a woman of seventy, still seeking my life. Do
      you not realize that? I feel that I shall never grow old!
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange a thing it is, Thyrsis, that you and I, who might do so much
      with so little chance, should have no chance at all. I read of other poets
      and their wives&mdash;at least they managed to have a hut on some
      hillside, and they did not absolutely starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am tired now; perhaps I can sleep. But I will tell you something,
      Thyrsis&mdash;does it sound so very foolish? Not only will I never grow
      old, but I will never give up your love! Yes, some day you will find out
      how to seek your vision in spite of the fact that I am your wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Another day, there would be moods of peace, and even of
      merriment; it was always like putting one's hand into a grab-bag, to open
      a new letter from Corydon. In after years he would read them, and strange
      were the memories they brought!
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Thyrsis," she wrote: "I have been reading a story of Heine in
      Zangwill's "Dreamers of the Ghetto". I did not know about Heine. He loved
      and married a sweet little woman of the people&mdash;Mathilde&mdash;who
      didn't appreciate his writings. I am not only going to love you, but I am
      going to appreciate your writings! Some day I am going to be educated&mdash;and
      won't it be fine when I am educated?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I keep very busy, but I have not so much time as I had last summer. I
      live almost all my life in hope&mdash;the present is nothing. I think I
      get more strength by gazing at my baby than in any other way. I wonder if
      I can ever infuse into him my inspiration and my desire. It is wonderfully
      exciting to me to think of what a free soul could do, if it possessed my
      spirit and my dreams. Ah, even you don't know! I smile to myself when I
      think how surprised you might some day be! Oh, my baby, my baby, surely
      you will not fail me&mdash;little soul that is to be. This is what I say
      to him, and then I squeeze him in ecstasy, and he coughs up his milk. Dear
      funny little thing, that is so pleased with a red, white and blue rattle.
      At present he is grinning at it ecstatically&mdash;and he is truly most
      horribly cunning. His favorite expression is 'Ah-boo, ah-boo'; and is not
      that just <i>too</i> bright? Everybody tries to spoil him&mdash;even a
      twelve-year-old boy here wanted to kiss him. And wonder of wonders, he has
      two teeth appearing in his lower gums! Poor me&mdash;he bites hard enough
      as he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Beloved: I am sitting with my candle once more. It is too hot for a
      lamp. I have been reading 'Paradise Lost', and truly I am astonished that
      it is so beautiful. Also I have been reading a book about Unitarianism,
      and I did not know that such things had been written. But I think it is
      hardly worth while to call one's self a Unitarian. I was thinking that I
      will go back and read the Bible through. I would not mind, if I knew I did
      not have to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also; this week, I read 'Paul and Virginia'. Oh, do not write anything to
      me about our meeting, until you are sure it can be! It breaks my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did it ever occur to you that we might embark for the tropics? We'd have
      a hut, and I might learn to raise fruits and vegetables. I sigh for some
      verdant isle&mdash;and I am not joking. We might find some place where
      steamers came now and then, and some one in New York could attend to your
      manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-night I was trying to put my baby to sleep and he wouldn't go, but
      just lay in my lap and kicked and grinned. I tried to coax him to go to
      sleep, but if I was the least bit impatient he'd begin to cry. And then
      he'd grin at me so roguishly, as if to say, 'Let's play before I go to
      sleep!' Finally I looked right at him and said, 'Now, you have played long
      enough, and I wish you to be a good boy and go to sleep!' And then he
      laughed, and I put him on his side and he went to sleep! Wasn't that
      bright for a baby just seven months old?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I write you much more interesting letters than you write me. To
      be sure I have no books into which to put my thoughts. Also, I have a
      great deal of time to compose letters to you; Cedric wakes me up so much
      in the night, and often I cannot go to sleep again. It plays havoc with me
      as a rule; and yet sometimes, when I'm not too exhausted, there is a
      certain joy in watching by the dim candle light the rosy upturned face and
      the little groping mouth. Oh Thyrsis, he is all mine and yours, and we
      must make him glad he was borned, mustn't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Such letters would come at a time when Thyrsis was almost
      prostrated with exhaustion; and great waves of loneliness and yearning
      would sweep over him. Ah God, what a fate it was&mdash;to labor as he
      labored, and then to have no means of recreation or respite, no hand to
      smooth his forehead, no voice to whisper solace! Who could know the
      tragedy of that aspect of his life?
    </p>
    <p>
      There came one day an incident that almost broke his heart. Down the lake
      came a private yacht, beautiful and swift, clean as a new penny, its
      bronze and white paint glistening in the sunlight. It anchored not far out
      from the point where Thyrsis camped, and a boat put off, and from it three
      young girls stepped ashore. They were slender and graceful, clad all in
      white&mdash;as spotless as the vessel itself, and glowing with health and
      joyfulness. They cast shy glances at the tent, and asked Thyrsis to direct
      them to the nearest farm-house; he watched them disappear through the
      woods, and saw them return with a basket of fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at sunset, and there was a new moon in the sky, and the
      evening star trembled upon the bosom of the waters. There in the magic
      stillness lay the vessel&mdash;and suddenly came the sounds of a guitar,
      and of young voices singing. Wonderful to tell, they sang&mdash;not
      "ragtime" and "college songs," but the chorus of the "Rheintoechter," and
      Schubert's "Auf dem Wasser zu singen", and other music, unknown to
      Thyrsis, exquisite almost beyond enduring. It pierced him to the heart; he
      sat with his hands clenched, and every nerve of him a-quiver, and the hot
      tears raining down his cheeks. It was loveliness not of this earth, it was
      an apparition; that presence which had been haunting him ever since he had
      come to this spot&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
        Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
    Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,
        And hear old Triton blow his wreathéd horn."
</pre>
    <p>
      The music died away, and rose again; and the deeps of his spirit were
      opened, and ecstasy and grief welled up together within him. Then he made
      out that the anchor was being lifted; and he was tempted to spring up and
      cry out to them to stay. But no&mdash;what did they know of him? What
      would they care about him? So he crouched by the bank, drinking greedily
      the precious notes; and as the yacht with its gleaming lights stole away
      into the twilight, all the poet's soul went yearning with it. Still he
      could hear the faint strains swelling&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Blow, blow, breathe and blow,
    Wind of the western sea!"
</pre>
    <p>
      He sat with his face hidden in his hands, shuddering. Here he was,
      wrestling in the pit with sickness and despair&mdash;and there above him
      were the heights of art. If only he could live with such music, what
      prodigies could he not perform. And they who possessed it&mdash;did it
      mean to them what it meant to him? They who had everything that life could
      offer&mdash;music and art, freedom and beauty and health&mdash;all the
      treasures of life as their birthright&mdash;had they never a thought of
      those who had nothing, and were set to slave in the galleys of their
      pleasure-craft?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was always coming upon some aspect of this thing called Privilege.
      Corydon had suggested that there might be some work that she could do at
      home; and so one day he was looking over the advertisements in a
      newspaper, and came upon a composition by a man who was seeking a
      governess for his three children. It was written in a style all its own;
      it revealed a person accustomed to specify exactly what he wanted, and it
      occupied three or four inches, as if symbolic of the fact that he did not
      consider expense. He described the life of his children; they had servants
      and a tutor to attend to their physical and mental needs, and the father
      now sought a friend and, companion, to take charge of their spiritual and
      social development. The specifications evoked a picture of an
      establishment, in which all the community's resources, all the sciences
      and arts of civilization, were set at work to create joy and power for
      three young people. What a contrast it made with the care that little
      Cedric was getting, as revealed in his mother's letters!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis could see in his mind's eye the master and provider of this
      establishment. How well he knew the type&mdash;how often had he sat in
      some quiet corner and listened while it revealed itself. A man alert and
      aggressive; immaculate in appearance as the latest fashion-plate, and
      overlaid with a veneer of culture&mdash;yet underneath it still the
      predatory talons, the soul of the hawk. He was a "practical" man; that is,
      he understood profit. He was trained to see where profit lay, and swift to
      seize upon it. As a business-man he ruled labor, and crushed his
      competitors, and directed legislatures and political machines; as a lawyer
      he protected his kind from attack, as a judge he bent the law to the ends
      of greed. So he lived in palaces, and travelled about in private-cars and
      yachts, and had servants and governesses for his children, and valets and
      secretaries to attend himself. And whenever by any chance he got a glimpse
      of Thyrsis' soul, how he hated it! On the other hand, to Thyrsis he was a
      portent of terror. He ruled in every field of human activity; and yet one
      saw that if his rule continued, it would mean the destruction of
      civilization! Whenever Thyrsis met one of these men, whether in
      imagination or reality, he found himself with hands clenched, and every
      nerve of him a-tingle with the lust of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. A most trying thing it was to a man who carried the burden of
      the future in his soul&mdash;to have to wrestle with an obstinate stomach!
      But so it was again; the magic red liquid seemed to be losing its power.
      Then, the pot-boiler was not going well; and to cap the climax, the
      manuscripts stopped coming. Thyrsis, after waiting two or three weeks in
      suspense and dread, wrote to Mr. Ardsley, and received a reply to the
      effect that he would not be able to send any more. Mr. Ardsley had sent
      them because of his interest in the proposed "practical" novel; and now he
      had learned that the poet had been giving his time to the writing of an
      impossible play!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis' predicament was a desperate one, and drove him to a desperate
      course. It was now midsummer; and run down from overwork as he was, could
      he face the thought of returning to the sweltering city, to go to work in
      some office? Or was he to hire out as a farm-laborer, under he knew not
      what conditions? He recoiled from either of these alternatives; and then
      suddenly, as he racked his brains, a wild idea flashed over him. For years
      he had talked and dreamed of escaping from civilization. He had pictured
      himself upon some tropic island, where bananas and cocoanuts grew; or
      again in some Northern wilderness, where he might hunt and fish, and live
      like the pioneers. And now&mdash;why not do it? He had an axe and a rifle
      and a fishing-rod; and only a few days previously he had heard a man
      telling of a lake in the Adirondacks, where not a dozen people went in the
      course of a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early one morning the idea came to him; and within an hour he had
      struck his tent and packed his trunk. He stowed his camp-stuff and bedding
      in a dry-goods box, and leaving his tent with the farmer, he purchased a
      ticket to a place on the edge of the wilderness. He put up at a
      village-hotel, and the next day drove fifteen miles by a stage, and five
      more by a wagon, and spent the night at a lumber-camp far in the
      wilderness. The next day, carrying as much of his belongings as he could,
      he walked three miles more, and came to the tiny lake that was his goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps half a mile long; the virgin forest hung about it like a
      great green curtain, and the shadows of the blue mountains seemed as if
      painted upon its surface. Thyrsis gave a gasp of delight as he pushed
      through the bushes and saw it; he stripped and plunged into the crystal
      water&mdash;and hot and tired and soul-sick as he was, the coolness of it
      was like a clasp of protecting arms. There was a rock rising from the
      centre, and he swam out and stood upon it, and gazed about him at all the
      ravishing beauty, and laughed and whooped so that the mountains rang with
      the echoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found an abandoned "open-camp", or shed, the roof of which he made
      water-proof with newspapers and balsam-boughs. He cut fresh boughs for his
      bed, and spread his blankets upon them, and went back to the
      lumber-shanties, and purchased a box of prunes and a bag of rice. There
      were huckleberries in profusion upon the hills, and in the lakes were
      fish, and in the forests squirrels and rabbits, partridges and deer. There
      were the game-laws, to be sure; but there was also a "higher law", as
      eminent authorities had declared. As one of the wits at the lumber-camp
      put it, "If any wild rabbit comes rushing out to bite you, don't you
      hesitate to defend yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with the sum of one dollar and twenty-three cents in his pocket-book,
      Thyrsis began the happiest experience of his life. He watched the sun rise
      and set behind the mountains; and sometimes he climbed to the summits to
      see it further upon its way. He watched the progress of the tempests
      across the lake, and swam in the water while the rain splashed his face
      and the lightning splintered the pines in the forest. He crouched in the
      bushes and saw the wild ducks feeding, and the deer that came at sunset to
      drink. He watched the loons diving, and spying him out with their wild
      eyes&mdash;sometimes, as they rose in flight, beating the surface of the
      water with a sound like thunder. At night he heard their loud laughter,
      and the creaking cries of the herons flying past. Sometimes far up in the
      hills a she-fox would bark, or some too-aged tree of the forest would come
      down with a booming crash. Thyrsis would lie in his open camp and watch
      the moonlight through the pines, and prayers of thankfulness would well up
      within him&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Peace of the forest, rich, profound,
    Gather me closely, fold me round!"
</pre>
    <p>
      There had been much carrying and hard work to do before he was settled,
      and there was more of it all through his stay. He had to cook all his
      meals and clean up afterwards; and because the nights were cold and his
      blankets few, there was much firewood to be cut. Also, there was no food
      unless he went out and found it, and so he spent hours each day tramping
      about in the forests. By the time he had got home and had cleaned the game
      and cooked it, he was ravenously hungry, and there was never any question
      as to what would digest. This was just what he had sought; and so now,
      deliberately, he banned all the muses from his presence, and poured the
      rest of the dyspepsia-medicine into the lake. His muscles became hard, and
      the flush of health returned to his cheeks, and as he went about his tasks
      he laughed and sang, and shouted his defiance to the world. And to Corydon
      he wrote his newest plan&mdash;to earn a little in the city that winter,
      and come back in the early spring and build a log-cabin for herself and
      the baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. Twice a week his mail came to the lumbercamp, in care of the
      friendly foreman. Each time that he went out to get it, he hoped for some
      new turn. There was a publisher interested in "The Hearer of Truth", and
      an editor was reading "The Higher Cannibalism"; also, and most important
      of all, Miss Ethelynda Lewis had now had "The Genius" for nearly two
      months, and had not yet reported. Thyrsis wrote to remind her, and after
      another two weeks, he wrote yet more urgently. At last came a note&mdash;"I
      have been away from the city, and have not had a chance to read the play.
      I will attend to it at once." And then, after three weeks more, Thyrsis
      wrote again&mdash;and at last came a letter that made his heart leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read your play", wrote the popular <i>comédienne</i>: "I am very
      much interested in it indeed. I have asked my manager to read it, and will
      write you again shortly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sent this to Corydon, and again there was rejoicing and
      expectation. "If only I can get the play on," he wrote, "our future is
      safe, for the profits from plays are enormous. It will be a great piece of
      luck if I have found the right person at the first attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      More weeks passed. Thyrsis watched the pageant of autumn upon the
      mountains&mdash;he saw the curtains of the lake-shore change to gold and
      scarlet, and from that to pale yellow and brown; and now, with every
      lightest breeze that stirred, there were showers of leaves came fluttering
      to the ground. The deer left the lake-shore and took to the "hard-wood",
      and the drumming of partridges thundered at sunset. The nights were
      bitterly cold, and he spent a good part of his day chopping logs and
      carrying them to camp, so that he might keep a blazing fire all night.
      There were hunting-parties in the woods, and he got a deer, and sold part
      of it, and had the rest hanging near his camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then one night came the first snow-storm; in the morning it lay white
      and sparkling in the sunlight&mdash;and oh, the wonder of a hunting-trip,
      when the floor of the wilderness was like a page on which could be read
      the tale of all that happened in the night! One could hardly believe that
      so many creatures were in these woods&mdash;there were tracks everywhere
      one looked. Here a squirrel had run, and here a partridge; here had been a
      porcupine, with feet like a baby's, and here a fox, and here a bear with
      two cubs. And in yon hollow a deer had slept through the night, and here
      he had blown away the snow from the moss; here two bucks had fought; and
      here one of them had been started by a hunter, and had bounded away with
      leaps that it was a marvel to measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis nearly lost his life at these fascinating adventures; for another
      storm came up, and covered his tracks, and when he tried to find his way
      back by the compass, he found that he had forgotten which end of the
      needle pointed to the North! So he wandered about for hours; and in the
      end had to decide by the toss of a penny whether he should get out to the
      main road, or wander off into twenty miles of trackless wilderness,
      without either food or matches. Fortunately the penny fell right; and he
      spent the night at a farmhouse, and the next day got back to the
      lumber-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a letter from Ethelynda Lewis! Thyrsis tore it open and read
      this incredible message:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your play has been carefully considered, and I am disposed to accept it.
      It is certainly very unusual and interesting, and I think it can be made a
      success. There are, however, certain changes which ought to be made. I am
      wondering if you will come to the city, so that we can talk it over. It
      would not be possible to settle a matter so important by mail; and there
      is no time to be lost, for I am ready to go ahead with the work at once,
      and so is my manager."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. Nothing that the mail had ever brought to Thyrsis had meant so
      much to him as this. He was transported with delight. Yes, for this he
      would go back to the city!&mdash;But then, he caught his breath, realizing
      his plight. How was he to get to the city, when he had only three dollars
      to his name?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the problem over in his mind. Should he send a telegram to some
      relative and beg for help? No, he had vowed to die first. Should he write
      to the actress, and explain? No, for that would kill his chances. There
      was just one way to be thought of; venison in the woods was worth eleven
      cents a pound, and the smallest of deer would get him to the city!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so began a great adventure. Thyrsis wrote Miss Ethelynda that he would
      come; and that night he loaded up some more buckshot "shells", and before
      dawn of the next day was out upon the hunt. The snow was gone now; and
      with soft shoes on his feet he wandered all day through the wilderness&mdash;and
      was rewarded by two chances to shoot at the white tails of flying deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came night, and he rigged up a "jack", a forbidden apparatus made
      of a soap-box and a lantern and a tin-plate for a reflector. He had an
      ingenious arrangement of straps and cords, whereby he could fasten this
      upon his head; and he had found an old lumber-trail where the deer came to
      feed upon the soft grass. Down this he crept like a thief in the night,
      with the light gleaming ahead, and the deer tramping in the thickets and
      whistling their alarms. Now and then one would stand and stare, his
      eye-balls gleaming like coals of fire; and at last came the roar of the
      gun, and the jacklight tumbled to the ground. When Thyrsis lighted up
      again and went to examine, there were spots of blood upon the leaves&mdash;but
      no deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the next day he was up again at dawn, watching by one of the runways to
      the lake. And then came another tramp, through the thickets and over the
      mountains&mdash;and more shots at the "flags" of the elusive enemy.
      Thyrsis' back ached, and his feet were as if weighted with lead, but still
      he plodded on and on&mdash;it was his life against a deer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he had had a boat, so that he could have set up his "jack" in
      that! But he had no boat&mdash;and so he wrapped himself in blankets and
      sat to watch another runway at sunset; and when no deer came he decided to
      stay on until the moon rose. It was a bitterly cold night, and his hands
      almost froze to the gun-barrel when he touched it. And the moon rose, and
      forthwith went behind a cloud&mdash;and then came a deer!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was hardly a trace of motion in the air, but somehow the creature
      half-scented Thyrsis; and so it stood and trumpeted to the night. Oh, the
      wildness of that sound&mdash;and the thumping of the heart of the hunter,
      and the breathless suspense, and the burning desire. The deer would take a
      step, and a twig would crack; and then it would stand still again, and
      Thyrsis would listen, crouching like a statue, clutching his weapon and
      striving to penetrate the darkness. And then the deer would take two or
      three more steps, and stand again; and then, in sudden alarm, bound away;
      and then come back again, step by step&mdash;fascinated by this mysterious
      thing there in the darkness. For three mortal hours that creature pranced
      and cavorted about Thyrsis, while he waited with chattering teeth; then in
      the end it took a sudden fright, and went bounding away through the
      thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      So came another day's hunting; and at sundown another watch by a runway;
      and another deer, that approached from the wrong direction, and came upon
      a man, worn out by three days and nights of effort, lying sound asleep at
      his post!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there could be only one ending to this adventure. Thyrsis was out for
      a deer, and he would never quit until he got one. All his planning and
      wandering had availed him nothing; but now, the next morning, as he
      stepped out from his camp with a bucket in his hand&mdash;behold, at the
      edge of a thicket, a deer! Thyrsis stood rooted to the spot, staring
      blankly; and the deer stood staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a time of agony. Should he try to creep back to his gun, or should
      he make a sudden dash? He started to try the latter, and had a pang of
      despair as the deer whirled and bolted away. He leaped to the camp and
      grabbed his gun and sprang out into sight again&mdash;and there, off to
      the right, was another deer. It was a huge buck, with wide-spreading
      antlers, rising out of the bushes where it stood. It saw Thyrsis, and
      started away; and in a flash he raised his gun and fired. He saw the deer
      stumble, and he fired the other barrel; and then he started in wild
      pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been warned to beware of a wounded deer; but he forgot that&mdash;he
      forgot also that he had no more shells upon him. He ran madly through the
      forest, springing over fallen logs, plunging through thickets&mdash;he
      would have seized hold of the animal with his bare hands, if only he could
      have caught up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deer was badly hurt. It would leap ahead, and then stumble, half
      falling, and then leap again. Even in this way, the distance it covered
      was amazing; Thyrsis was appalled at the power of the creature, its
      tremendous bounds, the shock of its fall, and the crashing of the
      underbrush before it. It seemed like a huge boulder, leaping down a
      precipice; and Thyrsis stood at a safe distance and watched it. According
      to the poetry-books he should have been ashamed&mdash;perhaps moved to
      tears by the reproachful look in the great creature's eyes. But assuredly
      the makers of the poetry-books had never needed the price of a
      railroad-ticket as badly as Thyrsis did!
    </p>
    <p>
      He only realized that night how desperate his need had been. He lay in his
      berth on board a train for the city&mdash;while back at his "open-camp" a
      wild blizzard was raging, and the thermometer stood at forty degrees below
      zero. But Thyrsis was warm and comfortable; and also he was brown and
      rugged, once more full of health and eagerness for life. All night he
      listened to the pounding of the flying train; and fast as the music of it
      went, it was not fast enough for his imagination. It seemed as if the
      rails were speaking&mdash;saying to him, over and over and over again,
      "Ethelynda Lewis! Ethelynda Lewis! Ethelynda Lewis!"

      BOOK X. THE END OF THE TETHER

      <i>They sat still watching upon the hill-top, drinking in the scent of the
      clover. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if only we might have come back here!" she sighed. "If only tee had
      never had to leave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That way lies unhappiness" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," she answered; and then quoted&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour
        In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd hill!
    Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?"
</pre>
    <p>
      "I wonder," said he, "if the poet put as much into these stanzas as we
      find in them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 1. Through the summer Corydon had been living week by week upon the
      hope that her husband would be able to send for her; all through the fall
      she had been dreaming of the arrangements they would make for the winter.
      But by now it had become clear that they would have to be separated for a
      part of the winter as well. She had sent him long letters, full of hopes
      and yearnings, anxieties and rebellions; but in the end she had brought
      herself to face the inevitable. And then it transpired that even a greater
      sacrifice was required of her&mdash;she was to be forbidden to see Thyrsis
      at all! If a man did not support his wife, said the world, it was
      common-sense that he should not have any wife; that was the quickest way
      to bring him to his senses. And so the two had threshed out that problem,
      and chosen their course; they would live in the same city, and yet confine
      themselves to writing letters!
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious feeling it gave Thyrsis, to know that she was so near to him,
      and yet not to be going to meet her! He could not endure any part of the
      city where he had been with her, and got himself a hall bedroom on the
      edge of a tenement-district far up town. Then he had his shoes shined, and
      purchased a clean collar, and wrote Miss Ethelynda Lewis that he was ready
      to call. While he was waiting to hear from her, there came to him a
      strange adventure; assuredly one of the strangest that ever befell a
      struggling poet, in a world where many strange adventures have befallen
      struggling poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six months Thyrsis had not seen his baby; and there had come in the
      meantime so many letters, telling so many miraculous things about that
      baby! So many dreams he had dreamed about it, so many hopes and so many
      prayers were centered in it! Twenty-two hours had he sat by the bedside
      when it was born; and through all the trials that had come afterwards, how
      he had suffered and wept for it! Now his heart was wrung with longing to
      see it, to touch it&mdash;his child. He wrote Corydon that he could not
      stand it; and Corydon wrote back that he was right&mdash;he should surely
      see the baby. And so it was arranged between them that Thyrsis was to be
      at a certain place in the park, and she would send the nurse-girl there
      with little Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and sat upon a bench; and the hour came, and at last down the path
      strolled a nurse-girl, wheeling a baby-carriage. He looked at the girl&mdash;yes,
      she was Irish, as Cordon had said, and answered all specifications; and
      then he looked at the baby, and his heart sank into his boots. Oh, such a
      baby! With red hair and a pug-nose, plebeian and dull-looking&mdash;such a
      baby! Thyrsis stared at the maid again&mdash;and she smiled at him. Then
      she passed on, and he sank down upon a bench. Great God, could it be that
      that was his child? That he would have to go through life with something
      so ugly, so alien to him? A terror seized him. It was like a nightmare. He
      was hardly able to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he told himself it could not be! Corydon had written him all
      about the baby; it was beautiful, with a noble head; everyone loved it.
      But then, were not mothers notoriously blind? Had there ever been a mother
      dissatisfied with her child? Or a father either, for that matter? Was it
      not a kind of treason for him to be so disgusted with this one&mdash;since
      it so clearly must be his?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was none other in sight; and though he waited half an hour, none
      came. At last he could stand it no more, but hurried away to the nearest
      telegraph-office. "Has baby red hair?" he wrote. "Did he come to the
      park?" And then he went to his room and waited, and soon after came the
      reply: "Baby has golden hair. Nurse was ill. Could not come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read this, and then shut the door upon the messenger-boy, and
      burst into wild, hilarious laughter. He stood there with his arms
      stretched out, invoking all posterity to witness&mdash;"What do you think
      of <i>that?</i> What do you think of <i>that?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      And a full hour later he was sitting by his bedside, his chin supported on
      his hands, and still invoking posterity. "Will you ever know what I went
      through?" he was saying. "Will you ever realize what my books have cost?"
      Then he smiled grimly, thinking of Voltaire's cruel epigram&mdash;that
      "letters addressed to posterity seldom reach their destination!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Thyrsis received a reply to his note, and went to call upon Miss
      Ethelynda Lewis. Miss Lewis dwelt in a luxurious apartment-house on
      Riverside Drive, where a colored maid showed him into a big parlor, full
      of spindle-legged gilt furniture upholstered in flowered silk. Also the
      room contained an ebony grand piano, and a bookcase, in which he had time
      to notice the works of Maupassant and Marie Corelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Lewis entered, clad in a morning-gown of crimson "liberty". She
      was <i>petite</i> and exquisite, full of alluring dimples&mdash;and
      apparently just out of a perfumed bath. Thyrsis sat on the edge of his
      chair and gazed at her, feeling quite out of his element.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed herself on the flowered silk sofa and talked. "I am immensely
      interested in that play," she said. "It is <i>quite</i> unique. And you
      are so young, too&mdash;why, you seem just a boy. Really, you know I think
      you must be a genius yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis murmured something, feeling uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only thing is," Miss Lewis went on, "it will need a lot of revision
      to make it practical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what part?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The love-story, principally," said the other. "You see, in that respect,
      you have simply thrown your chances away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made your hero act so queerly. Everyone feels that he is in love
      with Helena&mdash;you meant him to be, didn't you? And yet he goes away
      from her and won't see her! Everyone will be disappointed at that&mdash;it's
      impossible, from every point of view. You'll have to have them married in
      the last act."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," continued Miss Lewis, "I am to play the part of Helena, and I
      am to be the star. And obviously, it would never do for me to be rejected,
      and left all up in the air like that. I must have some sort of a
      love-scene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But"&mdash;protested the poet&mdash;"what you want me to change is what
      my play is <i>about!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's a new kind of love," he stammered&mdash;"a different kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, people don't understand that kind of love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Miss Lewis, that's why I wrote my play! I want to <i>make</i> them
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't do anything like that on the stage," said Miss Lewis. "The
      public won't come to see your play." And then she went on to explain to
      him the conditions of success in the business of the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis listened, with a clutch as of ice about his heart. "I am very
      sorry, Miss Lewis," he said, at last&mdash;"but I couldn't possibly do
      what you ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't do it!" cried the other, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would not fit into my idea at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, don't you want to get your play produced?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it, I want to get my play produced. If I did what you want me
      to, it wouldn't be my play. It would be somebody else's play."
    </p>
    <p>
      And there he stood. The actress argued with him and protested. She showed
      him what a great chance he had here&mdash;one that came to a new and
      unknown writer but once in a lifetime. Here was a manager ready to give
      him a good contract, and to put his play on at once in a Broadway theatre;
      and here was a public favorite anxious to have the leading role. It would
      be everything he could ask&mdash;it would be fame and fortune at one
      stroke. But Thyrsis only shook his head&mdash;he could not do it. He was
      almost sick with disappointment; but it was a situation in which there was
      no use trying to compromise&mdash;he simply could not make a "love-story"
      out of "The Genius".
    </p>
    <p>
      So at last there came a silence between them&mdash;there being nothing
      more for Miss Lewis to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I suppose you won't want the play," said Thyrsis, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," she answered, with vexation. "I'll have to think about it
      again, and talk to my manager. I had not counted on such a possibility as
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they left it, and Thyrsis went away. The next morning he received a
      letter from "Robertson Jones, Inc.", asking him to call at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Robertson Jones, the great "theatrical producer", was large and
      ponderous, florid of face and firm in manner&mdash;the steam-roller type
      of business-man. And it became evident at once that he had invited Thyrsis
      to come and be rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Lewis tells me you can't agree about the play," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Thyrsis, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mr. Jones began. He told Thyrsis what he meant to do with this
      play. Miss Lewis was one of the country's future "stars", and he was
      willing to back her without stint. He had permitted her to make her own
      choice of a role, and she should have her way in everything. There were
      famous playwrights bidding for a chance to write for her; but she had seen
      fit to choose "The Genius".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Personally," said Mr. Jones, "I don't believe in the play. I would never
      think of producing it&mdash;it's not the sort of thing anybody is
      interested in. But Miss Lewis likes it; she's been reading Ibsen, and she
      wants to do a 'drama of ideas', and all that sort of thing, you know. And
      that's all right&mdash;she's the sort to make a success of whatever she
      does. But you must do your share, and give her a part she can make
      something out of&mdash;some chance to show her charm. Otherwise, of
      course, the thing's impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jones paused. "I'm very sorry"&mdash;began Thyrsis, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your idea in refusing?" interrupted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis tried to explain&mdash;that he had written the play to set forth a
      certain thesis, and that he was asked to make changes that directly
      contradicted this thesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever had a play produced?" demanded the manager abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you written any other plays?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your first trial! Well, don't you think it a good deal to expect that
      your play should be perfect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think"&mdash;began Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you see," persisted the other, "that people who have been in this
      business all their lives, and have watched thousands of plays succeed and
      fail, might be able to give you some points on the matter?"&mdash;And then
      Mr. Jones went on to set forth to Thyrsis the laws of the theatrical game&mdash;a
      game in which there was the keenest competition, and in which the "ante"
      was enormously high. To produce "The Genius" would cost ten thousand
      dollars at the least; and were those who staked this to have no say
      whatever in the shaping of the play? Manifestly this was absurd; and as
      the manager pressed home the argument, Thyrsis felt as if he wanted to get
      up and run! When Mr. Jones talked to you, he looked you squarely in the
      eye, and you had a feeling of presumption, even of guilt, in standing out
      against him. Thyrsis shrunk in terror from that type of personality&mdash;he
      would let it have anything in the world it wanted, so only it would not
      clash with him. But never before had it demanded one of the children of
      his dreams!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jones went on to tell how many things he would do for the play. It
      would go into rehearsal at once, and would be seen on Broadway by the
      first of February. They would pay him four, six and eight per cent., and
      his profits could not be less than three hundred dollars a week. With
      Ethelynda Lewis in the leading role the play might well run until June&mdash;and
      there would be the road profits the next season, in addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis' brain reeled as he listened to this; it was in all respects
      identical with another famous temptation&mdash;"The devil taketh him upon
      a high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then there is England"&mdash;the man was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" cried Thyrsis, wildly. "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>why</i> not?" demanded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's impossible! I <i>couldn't</i> do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean you couldn't do the writing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't know how to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, that's easily arranged. Let me get some one to collaborate
      with you. There's Richard Haberton&mdash;you know who he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Thyrsis, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the author of 'The Rajah's Diamond'&mdash;it's playing with five
      companions now, and its third season. And he dramatized 'In Honor's Cause'&mdash;you've
      seen that, no doubt. We have paid him some sixty thousand dollars in
      royalties so far. And he'll take the play and fix it over&mdash;you
      wouldn't have to stir a finger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sprang up in his agitation. "Please don't ask me, Mr. Jones," he
      cried. "I simply <i>could</i> not do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed strange to Thyrsis, when he thought it over afterwards, that the
      great Robertson Jones should have taken the trouble to argue so long with
      the unknown author of a play in which he did not believe. Was it that
      opposition incited him to persist? Or had he told Ethelynda Lewis he would
      get her what she wanted, and was now reluctant to confess defeat? At any
      rate, so it was&mdash;he went on to drive Thyrsis into a corner, to tear
      open his very soul. Also, he manifested anger; it was a deliberate affront
      that the boy should stand out like this. And Thyrsis, in great distress of
      soul, explained that he did not mean it that way&mdash;he apologized
      abjectly for his obstinacy. It was the <i>ideas</i> that he had tried to
      put into his play, and that he could not give up!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," persisted the manager&mdash;"write other plays, and put your ideas
      into them. If you've once had a Broadway success, then you can write
      anything you please, and you can make your own terms for production."
    </p>
    <p>
      That thought had already occurred to Thyrsis; it was the one that nearly
      broke down his resistance. He would probably have surrendered, had the
      play not been so fresh from his mind, and so dear to him; if he had had
      time enough to become dissatisfied with it, as he had with his first novel&mdash;or
      discouraged about its prospects, as he had with "The Hearer of Truth"! But
      this child of his fancy was not yet weaned; and to tear it from his
      breast, and hand it to the butcher&mdash;no, it could not be thought of!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. So he parted from Mr. Jones, and went home, to pass two of the
      most miserable days of his life. He had pronounced his "<i>Apage,</i> <i>Satanas!</i>"&mdash;he
      had turned his back upon the kingdoms of the earth. And so presumably&mdash;virtue
      being its own reward&mdash;he should have been in a state of utter bliss.
      But Thyrsis had gone deeper into that problem, and asked himself a
      revolutionary question: Why should it always be that Satan had the
      kingdoms of the earth at his bestowal? Thyrsis did not want any kingdoms&mdash;he
      only wanted a chance to live in the country with his wife and child. And
      why, in order to get these things, must a poet submit himself to Satan?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the third morning after his interview; and Thyrsis found in his
      mail another letter from Robertson Jones, Inc. It was a letter brief and
      to the point, and it struck him like a thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Ethelynda Lewis has decided that she wishes to accept your play as
      it stands. I enclose herewith a contract in duplicate, and if the terms
      are acceptable to you, will you kindly return one copy signed, and retain
      the other yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read, not long after that, of a young playwright who died of
      heart-failure; and he was not surprised&mdash;if all playwrights had to go
      through experiences such as that. He could hardly believe his eyes, and he
      read the letter over two or three times; he read the contract, with Mr.
      Jones' impressive signature at the bottom. He did not know anything about
      theatrical contracts, but this one seemed fair to him. It provided for a
      royalty upon the gross receipts, to be paid after the play had earned the
      expenses of its production. Thyrsis had hoped that he might get some cash
      in advance, but that was not mentioned. In the flush of his delight he
      concluded that he would not take the risk of demanding anything
      additional, but signed the contract and mailed it, and sent a telegram to
      acquaint Corydon with the glorious tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. One of the consequences of this triumph was that Thyrsis
      purchased a new necktie and half a dozen collars; and another was that an
      angry world was in some part appeased, and permitted the struggling poet
      to see his wife and child once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met in the park; and strange it was to him to see Corydon after six
      months' absence. She was beautiful as ever, somewhat paler, though still
      with the halo of motherhood about her. He could scarcely realize that she
      was his; she seemed like a dream to him&mdash;like some phantom of music,
      thrilling and wonderful, yet frail and unsubstantial. She clung to his
      arm, trembling with delight, and pouring out her longing and her grief.
      There came to them one of those golden hours, when the deeps of their
      souls welled up, and they pledged themselves anew to their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even stranger it was to see the child; to be able to look at him all he
      pleased, and to speak to him, and to hold him in his arms! He was as
      beautiful as Thyrsis could have wished, and the father had no trouble at
      all in being interested in him; his smiles were things to make the angels
      jealous. Thyrsis would push his carriage out into the park, and they would
      sit upon a bench and gaze at him&mdash;each making sure that the other had
      missed none of his fine points.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to make sounds now, and had achieved the word "puss-ée".
      This originally had signified the woolly kitten he carried with him, but
      now by a metonymy it had come to include all kinds of living things; and
      great was the delight of the parents when a big red automobile flashed
      past, and the baby pointed his finger, exclaiming gleefully, "Puss-ée!" It
      is an astonishing thing, how little it takes to make parents happy;
      regarded, purely as an abstract proposition, it would be difficult to
      explain why two people who possessed between them a total of sixty-four
      teeth, more or less, should have been so much excited by the discovery
      that the baby had four.
    </p>
    <p>
      But parenthood, as Thyrsis found, meant more than charming baby-prattle
      and the counting of teeth. Little Cedric's tiny fingers were twisted in
      his heart-strings&mdash;he loved him with a love the intensity of which
      frightened him when he realized it. And sometimes things went wrong, and
      then with a pang as from the stab of a knife would come the thought that
      he might some day lose this child. So much pain and toil a child cost, so
      much it took of one's strength and power; and then, such a fragile thing
      it was&mdash;exposed to so many perils and uncertainties, to the ravages
      of so many diseases, that struck like a cruel enemy in the dark! Corydon
      and Thyrsis were so ignorant&mdash;they were like children themselves; and
      where should they turn for knowledge? There were doctors, of course; but
      this took so much money&mdash;and even with all the doctors, see how many
      babies died!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was learning the bitter truth of Bacon's saying about "giving
      hostages to fortune." And dearly as he loved the child, the artist in him
      cried out against these ties. Where now was that care-free outlook, that
      recklessness, that joy in life as a spectacle, which made up so much of
      the artist's attitude? When one had a wife and child one no longer enjoyed
      tragedies&mdash;one lived, them; and one got from them, not <i>katharsis</i>,
      but exhaustion. One became timid and cautious and didactic, and other
      inartistic things. One learned that life was real, life was earnest, and
      the grave was not its goal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric had been weaned; but still he was not growing properly. Could it be
      that there was something wrong with what they fed him? Corydon would come
      upon advertisements telling of wonderful newly-discovered foods for
      infants, and giving pictures of the rosy and stalwart ones who were fed
      upon these foods. She would take to buying them&mdash;and they were not
      cheap foods either. Then, during the winter, the child caught cold; and
      they took that to mean that it had been in some way exposed&mdash;that was
      what everybody said, and what the name "cold" itself suggested. So Corydon
      would add more flannel dresses and blankets, until the unfortunate mite of
      life would be in a purple stew. And still, apparently, these mysterious
      "colds" were not to be thwarted. Thyrsis felt that in all this there must
      be something radically wrong, and yet he knew not what to do. Surely it
      should not have been such a task to keep life in one human infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, the training of the baby was going badly. He lived in close
      contact with nervous people who were disturbed if he cried; and so
      Corydon's energies were given to a terrified effort to keep him from
      crying. He must be dandled and rocked to sleep, he must be played with and
      amused, and have everything he cried for; and it was amazing how early in
      life this little creature learned the hold which he had upon his mother.
      His chief want had come to be to sleep all day and lie awake half the
      night; and during these hours of wakefulness he pursued the delightful
      pastime of holding some one's hand and playing with it. Corydon, nervous
      and sick and wrestling with melancholia, would have to lie awake for
      uncounted hours and submit to this torment. The infant had invented a name
      for the diversion; he called it "Hoodaloo mungie"&mdash;which being
      translated signified "Hold your finger". To the mother this was like the
      pass-word of some secret order of demons, who preyed upon and racked her
      in the night; so that never after in her life could she hear the phrase,
      even in jest, without experiencing a nervous shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. This was a period of great hopefulness for Thyrsis, but also of
      desperate struggle. For until the production of his play in January, he
      had somehow to keep alive, and that meant more hack-work. Also he had to
      lay something by, for after the rehearsals the play would go on the road
      for a couple of weeks, to be "tried on the dog"; and during that period he
      must have money enough to travel, and stay at hotels, and also to take
      Corydon with him, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rehearsals began an interesting experience for him; he was introduced
      into a new and strange world. Thyrsis himself was shy, and disposed to run
      away and hide his emotions; but here were people&mdash;the actor-folk&mdash;whose
      business it was to live them in sight of the world. And these emotions
      were their life; they were very intense, yet quick both to come and to go.
      Such people were intensely personal; they were like great children, vain
      and sensitive, their moods and excitements not to be taken too seriously.
      But it was long before Thyrsis came to realize this, and meanwhile he had
      some uncomfortable times. To each of the players, apparently, the interest
      of a play centered in those places in which he was engaged in speaking his
      lines; and to each the author of the play was a more or less benevolent
      despot, who had the happiness of the rest of the world in his keeping.
      Once at a rehearsal, when Thyrsis was engaged in cutting out one of the
      speeches attributed to "Mrs. Hartman", he discovered that lady standing
      behind him in a flood of tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning Thyrsis paid many visits to the apartment on Riverside
      Drive; for Miss Lewis professed to be very anxious that he should consult
      with her and tell her his ideas of her part. But Thyrsis soon discovered
      that what she really wanted was to have him listen to <i>her</i> ideas.
      Miss Lewis was at war with Thyrsis' portrayal of Helena&mdash;it was
      incomprehensible to her that Lloyd should not be pursuing her, and she
      playing the coquette, according to all romantic models. Particularly she
      could not see how Lloyd was to resist the particularly charming Helena
      which she was going to make. She was always trying to make Thyrsis realize
      this incongruity, and to persuade him to put some "charming" lines into
      her part. "You boy!" she would exclaim. "I believe you are as obstinate as
      your hero!" Miss Lewis was only two years older than the "boy", but she
      saw fit to adopt this grandmotherly attitude toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came Robertson Jones, suggesting a man who could play the part of
      Lloyd. But Miss Lewis declared indignantly that she would not have him,
      because he was not handsome enough. "If," she vowed, "I've got to make
      love to a man and be rejected by him, at least I'm not going to have it an
      ugly man!" When an actor was finally agreed upon and engaged, Thyrsis had
      a talk with him, and it seemed as if Miss Lewis, in her preoccupation with
      his looks, had overlooked the matter of his brains. But Thyrsis was so new
      at this game that he did not feel capable of judging. He shrunk from the
      thought of having any actor play his part&mdash;that was so precious and
      so full of meaning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the rehearsals began, Thyrsis speedily forgot this feeling. The
      most sensitive poet to the contrary notwithstanding, the purpose of a play
      is to be acted; and Thyrsis was like an inventor, who has dreamed a great
      machine, and now sees the parts of it appearing as solid steel and brass;
      sees them put together, and the great device getting actually under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rehearsals were held in a little hall on the East Side, and thither
      came the company&mdash;six men and three women. There was no furniture or
      setting, they all wore their street clothing, and in the beginning they
      went through their parts with the manuscript in their hands. And yet&mdash;they
      had been selected because they resembled the characters in the play; and
      every time they went over the lines they gave them with more feeling and
      understanding. So&mdash;vaguely at first, and then more clearly&mdash;the
      poet began to see them as incarnations of his vision. These characters had
      been creatures of his fancy; they had lived in it, he had walked and
      talked and laughed and wept with them. Now to discover them outside him&mdash;to
      be able to hear them with his physical ears and see them with his physical
      eyes&mdash;was one of the strangest experiences of his life. It was so
      thrilling as to be almost uncanny. It was a new kind of inspiration, of
      that strange "subliminal uprush" which made the mystery of his life. And
      it was a kind that others could experience with him. Corydon would come
      every day to the rehearsals, and for four or five hours at a stretch they
      would sit and watch and listen in a state of perfect transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. Also, there were things not in the manuscript which were sources
      of interest and delight. There was Mr. Tapping, the stage director, for
      instance; Thyrsis could see himself writing another play, just to get Mr.
      Tapping in. He was a man well on in years, and wrecked by dissipation&mdash;almost
      bald and toothless, and with one foot crippled with gout. Yet he was a
      perfect geyser of activity&mdash;bounding about the stage, talking
      swiftly, gesticulating&mdash;like some strange gnome or cobold out of the
      bowels of the earth. Thyrsis was the creator of the play, so far as
      concerned the words; but this man was to be the creator of it on the
      stage. And that, too, required a kind of genius, Thyrsis perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tapping had talked the problems out with him at the beginning&mdash;talking
      until two o'clock in the morning, in a super-heated office filled with the
      smoke of ten thousand dead cigars. He talked swiftly, eagerly, setting
      forth his ideas; to Thyrsis it was a most curious experience&mdash;to hear
      the vision of his inmost soul translated into the language of the
      Tenderloin! "Your fiddler's this kind of a guy," Mr. Tapping would say&mdash;"he
      knows he's got the goods, and he don't care whether those old fogies think
      he's dippy, or what the hell they think. Ain't that the dope, Mr. Author?"
      And Thyrsis would answer faintly that he thought that was "the dope."&mdash;This
      was a word that Mr. Tapping used every time he opened his mouth,
      apparently; it designated all things connected with the play&mdash;character,
      dialogue, action, scenery, music, costume. "That's the way to dope it out
      to them!" he would cry to the actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lewis, and Mr. Tilford, the leading man, moved through their parts
      with dignity; the stage director showed them the "business" he had laid
      out, but they did not trouble to act at rehearsals, and he did not
      criticize what they did. But all the other people had to be taught their
      roles and drilled in them; and that meant that Mr. Tapping had to have in
      him five actors and two actresses, and play all their seven parts as they
      came. Marvellous it was to see him do this; springing from place to place,
      and changing his whole aspect in a flash&mdash;now scolding shrewishly in
      the words of Violet Hartman, now discoursing, with the accent and manner
      of Prof, von Arne, upon the <i>psychopathia</i> <i>sexualis</i> of Genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know all the parts, of course; but that was never allowed to
      trouble him. He would take a sentence out of the actor's lips, and then go
      on to elaborate it in his Tenderloin dialect; or, if the scene was highly
      emotional, and required swift speech, he would fall back upon the phrase
      "and so and so, and so and so." He could run the whole gamut of human
      emotions with those words, "and so and so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that's no good!" he would cry to "Mrs. Hartman." "What are those
      words?&mdash;'Wretched, ungrateful son&mdash;do you care nothing at all
      for your parents' feelings? Do you owe us nothing for what we have done?
      And so and so? And so and so? And so and so?'" Mr. Tapping's voice would
      rise to a wail; and then in a flash he would turn to Moses Rosen (he
      called all the actors by their character-names). "That's your cue, Rosen,
      you rush in left centre, and throw up your hands&mdash;right here&mdash;see?
      And what's your dope?&mdash;oh yes&mdash;'I have spent seven thousand
      dollars on this thing! You have ruined me! You have betrayed me! And so
      and so! And so and so! And so and so!'&mdash;And then you run over here to
      the professor&mdash;'You have trapped me! And so and so!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day as the work progressed, and the actors came to know their
      lines, Thyrsis' excitement grew. The great machine was running, he was
      getting some sense of the power of it! And new aspects of it were revealed
      to him; there came the composer who was to do the incidental music, and
      the orchestra-leader who was to conduct it; there came the
      costume-designer and the scene-painter, and even the press-agent who was
      to "boost" the play, and wanted picturesque details about the author's
      life. Corydon and Thyrsis were invited to go with Mr. Tilford to select a
      wig, and with Mr. Tapping to see the carpenters who were building the
      various "sets", in a big loft over near the North River. As the two walked
      home each day after these adventures, it was all they could do to keep
      from hugging each other on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a thing of especial moment to Thyrsis, because it was the first
      time in his life that his art had received any assistance from the outside
      world&mdash;the first time this world had done anything but scold at him
      and mock him. Here at last was recognition&mdash;here was success! Here
      were material things submitting themselves to his vision, coming to him
      humbly to be taught, and to co-operate in the creation of beauty! So
      Thyrsis caught sudden glimpses of what his life might have been. He was
      like a man who had been chained in a black dungeon, and who now gets sight
      of the green earth and the blue sky, and smells the perfume of the flowers
      and hears the singing of the birds. With forces such as this at his
      command, the power of his vision would be multiplied tenfold; and he was
      transported with the delight of the discovery, he and Corydon found their
      souls once more in this new hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      So out of these moods there began the burgeoning of new plans in his mind.
      Even amid the rush of rehearsals, he was dreaming of other things to
      write; some time before "The Genius" had reached the public, he had
      finished the writing of "The Utopians"&mdash;that fragment of a vision
      which was perhaps the greatest thing he ever did, and certainly the most
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. As usual, the immediate occasion of the writing was trivial
      enough. It was his "leading lady" who was responsible for it. Miss Lewis
      had taken a curious fancy to Thyrsis&mdash;he was a new type to her, and
      it pleased her to explore him. "How in the world did you ever get him to
      marry you?" she would exclaim to Corydon. "I could as soon imagine a
      marble statue making love to me!" And she told others about this strange
      poet, who was obviously almost starving, and yet had refused to let
      Richard Haberton revise his play for him, and had all but refused to let
      Robertson Jones Inc., produce it. Before long she came to Thyrsis to say
      that one of her friends desired to meet him, and would he come to a
      supper-party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis heard this with perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A supper-party!" he exclaimed. "But I can't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;I have no clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody expects a poet to have clothes," laughed Miss Lewis. "Come in the
      garments of your fancy. And besides, Barry's a true Bohemian."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barry Creston, the giver of this party, was one of the sons of "Dan"
      Creston, the mine-owner and "railroad-king", who a short while before had
      been elected senator from a Western state under circumstances of great
      scandal. "The old man's a hard character, I guess," said Miss Lewis; "but
      you must not believe all you read in the papers about Barry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never read anything about him," said the other; and so Miss Lewis went
      on to explain that Griswold, the Wall Street plunger, had got a divorce
      from his wife after throwing her into Barry's arms; and that Barry's
      sister had married an Austrian arch-duke who had maltreated her, and that
      Barry had kicked him out of a hotel-window in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      This invitation was a cause of much discomfort to Thyrsis. He had not come
      to the point where he was even curious about the life of the Barry
      Crestons of the world; and yet he did not like to hurt Miss Lewis'
      feelings. She made it evident to him that she was determined to exhibit
      her "lion"; and so he said "all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper party was at the <i>Café</i> <i>de</i> <i>Bohême</i>, which was
      an Aladdin's palace buried underground beneath a building in the
      "Tenderloin". Fountains splashed in marble basins, and birds sang amid the
      branches of tropical flowering trees, while on a little stage a man in the
      costume and character of a Paris <i>apache</i> sang a song of ferocious
      cynicism. And after him came a Japanese juggler of prodigious swiftness,
      and then a fat German woman in peasant guise who sang folk-songs, and
      wound up with "O, du lieber Augustin!" After which the company joined in
      the chorus of "Funiculi, funicula" and "Gaudeamus igitur"&mdash;for the
      patrons of the "Boheme" were nothing if they were not cosmopolitan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cosmopolitan also was the company at Barry Creston's table. On one side of
      Thyrsis was Miss Lewis, and on the other was Mlle. Armand, the dancer who
      had set New York in a furore. Opposite to her was Scarpi, the famous
      baritone; and then there was Massey, a sculptor from Paris, and Miss Rita
      Seton, of the "Red Hussars" Company, and a Miss Raymond, a gorgeous
      creature with a red flamingo feather in her hat, who had been Massey's
      model for his sensational figure of "Aurora".
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there was Barry Creston himself: a new type, and a disconcerting
      one. He was not at all the "gilded youth" whom Thyrsis had expected to
      find; he was a man of about thirty, widely cultured, urbane and gracious
      in his manner, and quite evidently a man of force. He was altogether free
      from that crude egotism which Thyrsis had found to be the most prominent
      characteristic of the American man of wealth. He spoke in French with
      Armand and in Italian with Scarpi and in German with the head-waiter who
      worshipped before him; and yet one did not feel that there was any
      ostentation about it&mdash;all this was his <i>monde</i>. And although he
      exhaled an atmosphere of vast wealth, this, too, seemed a matter of
      course; he assumed that you also were provided with unlimited funds&mdash;that
      all the world, in fact, was in the same fortunate case. Evidently he was
      well-known at the "Bohême", for the waiters gathered like flies around the
      honey-pot, and the august head-waiter himself took the order, and beamed
      his approval at Barry's selections. So presently there flowed in a stream
      of costly viands, served in <i>outré</i> and fantastic fashion&mdash;many
      of them things not known even by name to Thyrsis. There were costly wines
      as well, and at the end an ice in the shape of a great basket of fruit,
      wonderfully carved and colored like life, resting upon a slab of ice,
      which in turn was set in a silver tray with handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was dazed at all this waste, and at the uproar in the place, where
      dozens of other parties were squandering money in the same blind fashion,
      and all laughing, chatting, joining in the choruses with the performers on
      the stage. Now and then he would catch a little of his host's
      conversation, which was of all the capitals of Europe, and of art-worlds,
      the very existence of which was unknown to him. And then, on his left
      hand, there was Mlle. Armand, deftly picking off the leaves of an
      artichoke and dipping them into <i>mayonnaise</i>, and saying in her
      little bird's voice, "They tell me, Monsieur, that you have <i>du génie</i>.
      Oh, you should go to Paree to live&mdash;it is not here that one
      appreciates <i>du génie</i>!" And, then while Thyrsis was working out an
      explanation of his failure to visit Paris, some one in the café caught
      sight of Scarpi, and there was a general call for him; and according to
      the genial custom of the "Bohême" he stood up, amid tumultuous applause,
      and sang one of his own rollicking songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the revelry went forward, while Thyrsis marvelled, and tried to hide
      his pain. There could be no question of any enjoyment for him&mdash;when
      he knew that the cost of this affair would have paid all his expenses for
      a winter! Doubtless what Barry Creston spent for his cigars would have
      saved Thyrsis and his family from misery all their lives; and he wondered
      if the man would have cared had he known. Barry was one of the princes of
      the new dispensation; and sometimes princes were compassionate, Thyrsis
      reflected. Apparently this one was all urbanity and charm, having no
      thought in life save to play the perfect host to brilliant artists and <i>demi-mondaimes</i>,
      and to skim the cream off the top of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then suddenly the conversation took a new turn, and Thyrsis got
      another view of the young prince. There had been trouble out in the
      Western mines; and some one mentioned it&mdash;when in a flash Thyrsis saw
      the set jaw and the clenched fist and the steel grey eye of old "Dan"
      Creston. (Thyrsis had read somewhere a sketch of this senator, whose
      fortune was estimated at fifty millions, and who ran the governments of
      three states.) Barry, it seemed, had had charge of the mines for three
      years&mdash;that was how he had won his spurs. In those days, he said,
      there had been no unions&mdash;he told with a quiet smile how he had
      broken them. Now again "agitators" had crept in, so that in some of the
      camps the men were being moved out bodily, and replaced by foreigners, who
      knew a good job when they had it. To make this change had taken the
      militia; but it would be done thoroughly, and afterwards there would be no
      more trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper-party broke up about two o'clock, and Miss Raymond, the lady of
      the flamingo hat, was the only one who showed any effects from all the
      wine that had been consumed. Thyrsis, to his great surprise discovered
      that his host had taken a fancy to him, and had asked Miss Lewis to bring
      him out to luncheon at the Creston place in the country. And so came the
      wonderful experience which brought to him the vision of "The Utopians."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. They went, one Saturday morning, in Miss Lewis' automobile&mdash;out
      to Riverside Drive, and up the valley of the Hudson. This was in itself a
      Utopian experience for Thyrsis, who had never before taken a trip in one
      of these magic chariots. It leaped over the frozen roads like a thing of
      life, and he lay back in the cushioned seats and closed his eyes and
      listened to the hum of the machinery, imagining what life might be for
      him, if he could rest like this when he was worn from overwork. It was
      like some great adventure in music, like a minstrel's chanting of heroic
      deeds; it was Nature with all her pageantry unrolled in a panorama before
      his eyes. And meantime Miss Lewis was chattering on about the play and its
      prospects; and about other plays and their prospects; and about the people
      at the supper-party and their various loves and hates.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they came to the great stone castle of the Crestons, set upon a
      mountain-top overlooking the valley of this "American Rhine." Thyrsis
      gasped when he saw it, and he gasped many times again while Barry was
      showing them about. For this place was a triumph of a hundred arts and
      sciences; into its perfections had gone all the skill of the architects
      and designers, the weavers and carpenters, the painters and sculptors of a
      score of centuries and climes. The very dairies, the stables, the
      dog-kennels were things to be wondered at and studied; and in the vast
      halls were single pictures over which Thyrsis would fain have lingered for
      hours. Then, best of all, the great portico, with its stone pillars, and
      its view of the noble river, and of the snow-clad hills, dazzling in the
      sunlight!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had luncheon; after which Barry played upon the organ, and Miss Lewis
      sat beside him and left Thyrsis to wander at will. He made his way out to
      the portico, and paced back and forth there; and while the organ rolled
      and thundered to him, the majesty of the scene swept over him, and in
      towering splendors his soul arose. He thought of the wretched room in
      which he was pent, he thought of his starved and struggling life; and all
      the rage of his defeated genius awoke in him. In the name of that genius
      he uttered his defiance, and by the title of it he took possession of this
      castle, and of all things it contained. Yes&mdash;for he was the true lord
      and master of it&mdash;he was the prince disinherited! And the meaning of
      it, its excuse for being, was this brief hour! For this its glories had
      been assembled; for this the architects and designers, the weavers and
      carpenters, the painters and sculptors had labored in a score of centuries
      and climes; for this the great organ had been built, and for this the
      great musician had composed&mdash;that he might behold, in one hour of
      transfiguration, what the life of man would be in that glad time when all
      the arts of civilization were turned to the fostering of the soul! When he
      who carried in the womb of his spirit the new life of the ages, would be
      loved instead of being hated, would be cherished instead of being
      neglected, would be reverenced instead of being mocked! When palaces would
      be built for him and beauty and joy would be gathered for him, and the
      paths would be made clear before his feet! So out of boundless love and
      rapture would he speak to men, and bring to them those gifts that were
      beyond price, the treasures of his unfolding inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that the Utopians came to Thyrsis; those men of the future,
      worshippers of joy! They came to him, alive and in the flesh, beautiful
      and noble, gracious and free-hearted&mdash;as some day they will come, if
      so the earth endure; as they will stand upon that portico, and listen to
      that music, and gaze upon the valley of that American Rhine! And will they
      remember the long-dead dreamer, and how they walked with him there and
      spoke with him; how they put their arms about him, and gave him of their
      love and understanding? Will they remember what shuddering rapture their
      touch conveyed to him; how the tears ran down his cheeks, and he pledged
      his soul to yet more years of torment, so only their glory might come to
      be upon earth? Will they read the blazing words in which he pictured them,
      the trumpet-blast he sounded to the dead souls of his time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis knew that this was the greatest hour of his life, and he fought
      like mad to hold it. But that might not be&mdash;the music ceased, and he
      heard the voices of his host and Miss Lewis. They came to the door; and
      then Thyrsis' thoughts came back quickly to earth. For he saw that Barry
      Creston's arm was about the woman, and she was leaning upon him; nor did
      they separate when they saw him, but stood there, smiling; so that at last
      Thyrsis had solved for him the problem of their relationship. It was not
      so that the Utopians loved, he thought, as he watched them; and found
      himself wondering if young Creston was as imperious with his women as he
      was with the slaves in his Western mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car came to the door, and they parted from their host and sped back to
      the city. "What do you think of him?" asked Miss Lewis&mdash;and went on
      in a burst of confidence to tell him that it was to this prince of the new
      dispensation that he owed the great chance of his life. For it was Barry
      Creston who had given the Broadway "show-girl" the start that had made her
      a popular <i>comédienne</i>; it was Barry Creston who had awakened in her
      an interest in the "drama of ideas", and had set her to fermenting with
      new ambitions; and finally it was Barry Creston who in a moment of
      indulgence had promised the money which had set the managers and actors
      and musicians, the stage-carpenters and scene-painters and press-agents to
      work at the task of embodying "The Genius"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. It may have been a coincidence; but from that hour dated the
      process of Thyrsis' disillusionment concerning the production of his play.
      Could it be, he asked himself, that such wealth as Barry Creston's could
      buy true art? Could it be that forces set in motion by it could really
      express his vision? "Genius surrounded by Commercialism", had been the
      formula of his play; and did not the formula describe his own position as
      well as Lloyd's?
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange thing was this theatrical business&mdash;the business of selling
      emotions! One had really to feel the emotions, in order to portray them
      with force; yet one had at the same time to appraise them with the eye of
      the business-man&mdash;one must not feel emotions that would not pay.
      Also, one boomed and boosted his own particular emotions, celebrating
      their merits in the language of the circus-poster. If you had taken up a
      certain play, you considered it the greatest play that had ever made its
      bow to Broadway; and you actually persuaded yourself to believe it&mdash;at
      least those who made the real successes were men who possessed that
      hypnotic power.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, for instance, Mr. Rosenberg, the press-agent and
      advertising-man. He was certain that "The Genius" was a play of genius,
      and its author a man of genius; and yet Thyrsis knew that if it had been
      Meyer and Levinson, across the street, who were producing it, Mr.
      Rosenberg would have called it "rot". Mr. Rosenberg was to Thyrsis a
      living embodiment of Moses Rosen in the play&mdash;so much so that he felt
      the resemblance in the names to be perilous, and winced every time he
      heard Rosenberg speak of Rosen. But fortunately neither Rosenberg nor
      Rosen possessed a sense of irony, and so there were no feelings hurt.
      Thyrsis had written the play without having met either a press-agent or
      the head of a music-bureau; he had drawn the character of Moses after the
      fashion of the German, evolving the idea of an elephant out of his inner
      consciousness. But now that it was done, he was amazed to see how well it
      was done; he was like an astronomer who works out the orbit of a new
      planet, and afterwards discovers it with his telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the preparations neared completeness, Thyrsis found himself more and
      more disturbed about the production. He was able to judge of the actors
      now, and they seemed to him to be cheap actors&mdash;to be relying for
      their effects upon exaggeration, to be making the play into a farce. But
      when he pointed this out to Mr. Tapping, Mr. Tapping was offended; and
      when he spoke to Mr. Jones, he was referred to Miss Lewis. All he could
      accomplish with Miss Lewis, however, was to bring up the eternal question
      of the lack of "charm" in her part. Poor Ethelynda was also getting into
      an unhappy frame of mind; she had begun to doubt whether the "drama of
      ideas" was her <i>forte</i> after all&mdash;and whether the ideas in this
      particular drama were real ideas or sham. She got the habit of inviting
      friends in to judge it, and she was always of the opinion of the last
      friend; so the production was like a ship whose pilot has lost his
      bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time drew near for the opening-performance, which was to be given in a
      manufacturing city in New England. The nerves of all the company were
      stretched to the breaking point; and overwrought as he was himself,
      Thyrsis could not but pity the unhappy "leading lady", who could hardly
      keep herself together, even with the drugs he saw her taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "dress-rehearsal" began at six o'clock on Sunday evening; and from the
      very start everything went wrong. But Thyrsis did not know the peculiar
      fact about dress-rehearsals, that everything always goes wrong; and so he
      suffered untellable agonies at the sight of the blundering and stupidity.
      Mr. Tapping stormed and fumed and hopped about the stage, and swore, first
      at his gouty foot, and then at some member of the company; and he sent
      them back, over and over again through the scenes&mdash;it was midnight
      before they finished the first act, and it was six o'clock in the morning
      before they finished the second, and it was nearly noon of Monday before
      the wretched men and women went home to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had left before that, partly because he could not endure to see
      the mess that things were in, and partly because they told him he would
      have to make a speech that night, and he had to spend two of his
      hardearned dollars for the hire of a dress-suit. Here, as always, the
      scarcity of dollars was like a thorn in his flesh. He had been obliged to
      leave Corydon heart-broken at home, because he had not been able to lay by
      enough to bring her; he had to stay at a cheap hotel&mdash;cheaper even
      than any of the actors; and when Miss Lewis and Mr. Tapping went out to
      lunch, he would have to say that he was not hungry, and then go off and
      get something at a corner grocery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of the performance came; and Thyrsis, like a gambler who has
      staked all his possessions upon the turn of one card, sat in a box and
      watched the audience and the play. The house was crowded; and the
      play-wright saw with amazed relief that all his agonies of the night
      before had been needless&mdash;the performance went without a hitch from
      beginning to end. And also, to his unutterable delight, the play seemed to
      "score". He had gazed at the rows of respectable burghers of this
      prosperous manufacturing town, and wondered what understanding they could
      have of his tragedy of "genius". But they seemed to be understanding; at
      any rate they laughed and applauded; and when Lloyd smashed the violin
      over von Arne's head and the curtain went down, there was quite a little
      uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis came out and made his timid speech, which was also applauded; and
      then came the last act, and the women got out their handkerchiefs on
      schedule time, and Mr. Rosenberg stood behind Thyrsis in the box, rubbing
      his hands together gleefully. So the play-wright sent a telegram to his
      wife, saying that the play was a certain success; and then he went to bed,
      assuredly the happiest man who had ever slept in that fifty-cent hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas&mdash;the next morning, there were the local papers; and with one
      accord they all "roasted" the play! Their accounts of it sounded for all
      the world like the play itself&mdash;those extracts which the two
      professors had read from the criticisms of Lloyd's concert! Thyrsis
      wondered if the critics must not have taken offence at the satire!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, going to the theatre, the first person he met was Rosenberg, who
      sent another chill to his heart. "First nights are always good," said Mr.
      Rosenberg. "It was all 'paper', you know. To-night is the real test."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the second performance came; and in the theatre were some two
      hundred people, and the occasion was the most awful "frost" that ever
      froze the heart of an unhappy partisan of the "drama of ideas". After
      which, according to schedule, the play moved to another manufacturing
      town; and in the theatre were some two hundred and fifty people&mdash;and
      a frost some ten degrees lower yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. So at twelve o'clock that night there was a consultation in a
      room at the hotel, attended by Thyrsis and Miss Lewis and Mr. Tapping and
      Mr. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said the last named; "the play is a failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely!" said Mr. Tapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it would be!" cried Miss Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you?" asked Mr. Jones of Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has not succeeded in these towns," said Thyrsis. "But then&mdash;how
      could it succeed, except where there are intellectual people? You promised
      to take it to New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use!" declared Jones. "New York would laugh it dead in one
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would," said Mr. Tapping, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it all along," cried Miss Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went on for ten minutes; and then, "What are you going to do?"
      asked Thyrsis, in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The play must be altered," said Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How altered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be altered as Miss Lewis asked you at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sprang up. "What!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be done!" said Mr. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must," said Mr. Tapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it all along!" cried Miss Lewis again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I won't stand for it!" exclaimed Thyrsis, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be done!" said Mr. Jones, in his heaviest steam-roller tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I won't have it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go to law! I'll get an injunction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there in our contract to prevent our altering the play?" demanded
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" gasped Thyrsis. "You know what our understanding was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the other. "Can you prove it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you mean that you would go back on that understanding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you mean that you expect me to see this money wasted and the play
      sent to pot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis, in his agony, turned to Miss Lewis. "Will you let him break our
      bargain?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what else is there to be done?" she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see that the play is a failure? And don't you see the plight
      you've got me in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was dumb with dismay. He stared from one of these people to
      another, and his heart went down&mdash;down. He saw that his case was
      hopeless. He had no one to help him or to advise him, and he had less than
      eleven dollars in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you propose to do?" he asked, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already telegraphed to Richard Haberton," said Jones. "He will
      meet us and see the next two performances; and then we'll lay the company
      off until we get some kind of a practical play."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the steam-roller rolled and the matter was settled; and Thyrsis,
      broken-hearted, bid the trio farewell, and took an early train back to New
      York.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw any member of the company again&mdash;and he never saw the
      "practical play" which Mr. Richard Haberton made out of "The Genius". What
      was done he gathered from the press-clippings that came to him&mdash;the
      famous author of "The Rajah's Diamond" caused Helena to fall into Lloyd's
      arms at the end of the second act, and had them safely if not happily
      married at the beginning of the third. Also he wrote several "charming"
      scenes for Ethelynda Lewis, and two weeks later the play had a second
      opening in another manufacturing town of New England&mdash;where the
      critics, awed by the name of the distinguished dramatist upon the
      play-bills, were moved to faint praise. But perhaps it was that Mr.
      Richard Haberton required more than two weeks' time for the evolving of
      real "charm"; at any rate the audience came in no larger numbers to see
      this new version, and the misbegotten production lived for another six
      performances, and died a peaceful death at the very gates of the
      metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such was the end of Thyrsis' career as a play-wright. In return for
      all his labors and his agonies he received some weeks later a note from
      Robertson Jones, Inc., to the effect that the books of "The Genius" showed
      a total deficit of six thousand seven hundred and forty-two dollars and
      seventeen cents; and accordingly, under the contract, there was nothing
      due to the author.

      BOOK XI. THE TORTURE-HOUSE
    </h2>

      <i>They sat in the darkness, watching where the starlight gleamed upon the
      water. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had always hope," she was saying. "How endlessly we hoped!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could we do it now?" he asked; and after a pause, he quoted from the poem&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           "Unbreachable the fort
    Of the long-batter'd world uplifts its wall;
        And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,
        And near and real the charm of thy repose,
    And night as welcome as a friend would fall!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. Thyrsis came home beaten and crushed, worn out with overwork and
      worry, his heart black with rage and bitterness and despair. He met
      Corydon in the park, and she listened to his story, white and terrified.
      She had swallowed all her disappointment, had stayed at home with the baby
      while he went with the play; and now the outcome of it all was this!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" she whispered; and he answered, "I don't know.
      I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the terrible state he was in, and she dared not utter a single
      word of her own grief. She bit her lip, and choked back her tears. "This
      is my life," she thought to herself; "I must endure, endure&mdash;that is
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not afford even to sit and talk with her very long; there was no
      time to indulge in the luxury of despair. His money was gone, and he was
      in debt for some that he had borrowed. Since irregular eating had been
      telling upon him again, he had been getting his meals with an acquaintance
      of the family, who kept a boarding-house uptown. On the strength of his
      prospects, she had trusted him for four dollars a week; and now the play
      had failed, and he had to go and tell her, and listen to new protests as
      to his folly in refusing to "get a position". But in the end she bade him
      stay on; and so he was divided between his shame, and the need of
      something to eat day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time dragged on, and still there was no gleam of light. There were
      shameful hours in these weeks&mdash;he touched the lowest point yet in his
      life. This was a typical cheap boarding-house, a place where the drudges
      of trade were herded; it was a home of sordidness and ugliness&mdash;to
      Thyrsis its people seemed like carefully selected types of all things that
      he hated in the world. There was a young broker's clerk, whose patter was
      of prices, and of fortunes made without service. There was a grey-haired
      bookkeeper for a giant "trust", a man who could not have had more pride in
      that great engine of exploitation, or more contempt for its victims, had
      he been the president and chief owner thereof. There was a young
      divinity-student, who made greedy reaches for the cake-plate, and who
      summed up for Thyrsis all the cant and commonness of the church. There was
      a dry-goods clerk, who wore flaring ties, and who played the role of a
      "masher" upon the avenue every evening. And finally there was a red-faced
      Irish-man who wore large shiny cuffs and a false diamond, and who held
      some political job, and was voluble in behalf of "the organization".
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these people Thyrsis sat three times a day, silent and tortured,
      paying a high price for each morsel of food he ate. But also he was
      lonely, and craving any sort of respite; and in the course of time he
      became acquainted with several of the younger men. One of the diversions
      in their pitiful and narrow lives was to gather in some room and indulge
      in petty gambling; sitting for hours upon hours with their faculties alert
      upon the attempt to get from each other some small fraction of that weekly
      stipend which kept them alive. Sometimes they played "penny-ante", and
      sometimes <i>vingt</i> <i>et</i> <i>un</i>; once, as it chanced, they
      needed another player, and they urged Thyrsis to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, for the first time in his life, Thyrsis learned what it meant to
      lay his soul upon the lap of the goddess of chance. From eight o'clock
      that evening until two the next morning, he sat in a suffocating room full
      of cigarette-smoke, trying in vain to win back the dollar or two he had
      lost at the outset; flushed and trembling with excitement, and hating
      himself with a bitter and tormenting hatred. And so he discovered his
      vice; he discovered that he had in him the soul of the gambler! And all
      the rest of the winter he had to wrestle with that shame. He would go to
      his dinner, tired and heartsick; and they would ask him to play again; and
      he&mdash;the man who carried a message for humanity in his heart&mdash;he
      would yield! Three times during that winter he fell into the mire; on
      Washington's birthday he began to play in the morning, and stopping only
      for meals, he played until long after midnight. Forever afterwards he was
      a humbler and a gentler man because of that experience; understanding how
      squalor abases one, and how swiftly and stealthily an evil passion closes
      its grasp about the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Of this shameful thing he said not a word to Corydon. But he
      avoided meeting her, because of the depths of his despair. And so at last
      there came a letter from her&mdash;a long and unusual one. Corydon, too,
      was having her troubles, it appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am writing in haste," she said; "I shall mail the letter at once,
      before my resolution fails me. At least a dozen times I have made up my
      mind to tell you or to write you what is here, and each time I have turned
      back. But now I have got to a stage where I must have your help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I enclose a long letter which I wrote you years ago, before we were
      married. I was looking over some old papers the other day and came upon
      it. Generally when I wrote you letters that I did not send, I tore them
      up; but something led me to keep this one&mdash;I had a feeling that some
      day it would be interesting as a curiosity. You see, I am always
      persuading myself that I can get over this trouble, and learn to laugh at
      it; and I am always succeeding&mdash;but only to have it crop up in some
      different form. I have told you a little of it now and then&mdash;but stop
      and read the enclosed, and you will see."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis read the old letter&mdash;a missive of anguish and terror, and
      beginning with elaborate preludings and hesitations:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I implore you to be patient with me this once; and when I have gotten
      through, I want you still to love me, if possible. I have been trying to
      get the courage to write you something that is so mean and low, childish
      and almost imbecile, that there have been moments in which my horror of it
      was absolutely unspeakable; when I have imagined myself as a soul damned,
      when I thought that if you knew, you would think I had a diseased brain. I
      only ask you to read patiently what I am going to write; but know that
      every word is a horrible effort, that it is torture and humiliation to me
      to write it. I have a feeling now as though I were psychologically
      dissecting something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have been eight years ago, when I was sick in bed; in a fever or
      delirium I conceived the idea that there was a coffin under my bed. The
      thought took hold of me, somehow, like an octopus, and I used to writhe
      under it, and get into fearful perspirations. I never went near a bed that
      I didn't think of this thing with the same horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I seemed to have created a nervousness, a sense of dread, before
      which I was absolutely helpless. I cannot tell you how hopelessly or
      fearfully I suffered, or what depths of despondency and despair and
      blackness I was cast into. I cannot understand how a creature could so
      manufacture torments for itself. But this is not all, just for once have
      mercy&mdash;and yet even now I am laughing at myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The winter I was sixteen I was much disappointed that I could not go to
      college, and almost the whole winter, when I was not diverted, I would
      brood over this habit. As I grew older, it would come to me in spasms, and
      it seemed to my dawning sense so monstrously child-like, so insane, that I
      was aghast that it had power to affect me. I can find no words to tell you
      of the unspeakable horror with which I saw, in my older days, that a
      thought could so torment me; the mere fact of its being able to torment I
      could never forget. I know it was silly, unreasonable; and yet every time
      it came to me I would be plunged into a hopelessness and melancholy, than
      which I can honestly conceive nothing more fearful upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I continued to pursue myself with this morbidity (I would almost,
      rather kill myself than write this). As I got older my terror was less,
      but my melancholy greater, until I would be only half conscious of what I
      was allowing myself to do. I seemed to have engendered within myself a
      hob-goblin. Once&mdash;it was only last winter&mdash;I saw a nasty word
      written on a fence, and it sent a shudder through me, for I knew it would
      follow me and make me think of other things like it. I felt, since
      thoughts have such power to terrorize me, how can I ever get away from
      them?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how I have struggled&mdash;tried to say it was not true&mdash;that I
      was just as sane as other people! And this made my thirst for beauty all
      the more maddening, and my melancholy all the more complete! So I have
      lived, at intervals, and words cannot describe the hell that I have
      endured, the more horrible because it seemed to me so unreasonable, so
      insane. It occurred to me more or less this summer, though in a milder
      form; but it often frightened me more than ever, as I felt how beautiful
      you were, and what you would think of me, if you knew I was capable of
      being the prey of such thoughts. So they were always more dreadful to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you possibly understand how the thought of a word could make me
      shudder? The mere idea of my being capable of thinking of anything that
      was not beautiful! When I longed to be only the embodiment of beauty&mdash;and
      sometimes I <i>am</i> beautiful! I look into the glass, and I seem to have
      something in my face that is a promise of a glory to come&mdash;a light, a
      something,&mdash;I love to imagine it. And then, that a thought should
      knock me prone, and make me cringe&mdash;from the mere fact of its lowness
      and meanness!
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the last two or three days I have again victimized myself; and when I
      was not studying I was asking myself in anguish what was the matter with
      me, and if there was no hope for me on earth. I dodged around and tried to
      laugh it off, then I went to the piano and lost myself in the
      dissatisfaction of my playing; but when I stopped, I was conscious of a
      great depression, as though I were chained in a dungeon. I jumped up, and
      said I could stand it no longer. I will tell Thyrsis, I said; but no, I
      will die first! I added. He could not tolerate me afterwards, he would
      think me only fit for the insane-asylum. Oh, why should I be so cursed?
      And then, somehow, I imagined that I told you, and that you laughed at me,
      that you pitied me&mdash;and that you held out your hand, and said, 'Come,
      you <i>shall</i> find beauty&mdash;poor, deluded, wretched, little
      creature!' I really imagined that this had happened, and I was relieved as
      with a draught of fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God in Heaven, to think that I could ever have been so degraded! My
      head hurts, and I absolutely am dazed, to think that I have been able to
      write you of something for which (though it has not been my making) I am
      so ashamed and humiliated I can hardly hold my head up. I think in my
      short life I have atoned for the sins of many souls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Such was the old-time letter. "And now," wrote Corydon, "I don't
      want you to think that if I did not send you this, it was because I was
      afraid to do it, or unwilling to trust to your love. It was simply because
      I felt that I could conquer these things&mdash;that it would be weak and
      contemptible of me not to do so. Nor is the reason I write you now that I
      have not been able to conquer them, that I am still at the mercy of such
      habits. I am a grown woman, and I am not afraid of words; I tell myself
      this a hundred times; and it is true&mdash;and yet there is a way in which
      it is not true. The thing is so intricate&mdash;I never get to the end of
      it; I rid myself of the fear of a hateful idea, but there remains the fact
      that I should have been afraid; there is the fear of fear. And then comes
      a flood of shame&mdash;that I should have it in me to be afraid of fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis, as I write to you now I see clearly how perfectly preposterous
      and unreal all this is; and again there comes to me the impulse to tear up
      this letter, and banish the troop of hob-goblins from my mind. But no,
      this time I am determined to make a clean breast of the thing&mdash;for I
      see that secrecy and solitude are what it feeds on. If I were happy and
      busy with you such ideas would have no power over me. But think how it is,
      with my loneliness and despair! I don't want to say anything to make your
      task harder&mdash;but oh, Thyrsis, it is frightful to have nothing to do
      but wait, and wait, and wait! The baby wakes me up in the night and I lie
      for hours&mdash;it is at such times that these phantoms take hold of me.
      Do you realize that I literally never know what it is to have more than
      three or four consecutive hours of sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am not insane, I tell myself; I am not insane! It is the
      circumstances of my life that cause this melancholia and misery. It has
      been my life, from the very beginning&mdash;for what a hopeful and joyous
      creature I would have been, had I only had a chance as a girl! I know
      that; and you must tell it to me, and help me to believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read this with less surprise than Corydon had imagined; for she
      had been wont to drop hints about her trouble from time to time. He was
      shocked, however, to find what a hold it had taken upon her; the thing
      sent a chill of fear to his heart. Could it be after all that she had some
      taint? But he saw at once that he must not let her see any such feeling;
      the least hint of it would have driven her to distraction. On the
      contrary, he must minimize the trouble, must help her to laugh it away, as
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to meet her in the park, and found her in an agony of distress;
      she had mailed the letter, and then she had wished to recall it, and had
      been struggling ever since with the idea that he would be disgusted with
      her. Now, when she found that such was not the case, that he still loved
      her and trusted her, she was transported with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But dearest," he said, "how absurd it is to be ashamed of an idea! If
      ugly things exist, don't we have to hear of them and know of them? And so
      why frighten ourselves because they are in our minds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis," cried she, "they are so hateful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said. "But then the more you hate them, the more they haunt
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what harm can they do? Can they have any effect upon your character?
      You must say to yourself that all this is a consequence of the structure
      of your brain-cells. What could be more futile than trying to forget? As
      if the very essence of the trying was not remembering!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went on to argue with her. He made her promise him that in
      future she would tell him of all her obsessions, permitting no fear or
      shame to deter her; and so thereafter he would have to listen periodically
      to long accounts of her psychological agonies, and help her to hunt out
      the "hob-goblins" from the tangled thickets of her mind. They were forever
      settling the matter, positively and finally&mdash;but alas, only to have
      something unsettle it again. So Thyrsis had to add to his other
      accomplishments the equipment of a psycho-pathologist; he brushed up his
      French, and read learned treatises upon the researches in the <i>Salpêtrière</i>,
      and the theories of the "Nancy School".
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. Another month passed by, and still there was no rift in the
      clouds. Once more Corydon was forbidden to see him, and so her pain grew
      day by day. At last there came another letter, voicing utter despertion.
      Something must be done, she declared, she was slowly going out of her
      mind. Thyrsis could have no idea of the shamefulness of her position, the
      humiliations she had to face. "I tell you the thing is putting a brand
      upon my soul," she wrote. "It is something I shall never get over all my
      life. It is withering me up&mdash;it is destroying my self-respect, my
      very decency; it is depriving me of my power to act, or even to think.
      People come in, relatives or friends&mdash;even strangers to me&mdash;and
      peer at me and pry into my affairs; I hear them whispering in the parlor&mdash;'Hasn't
      he got a position yet?' or 'How can she have anything to do with him?' The
      servants gossip about me&mdash;the woman I have for a nurse despises me
      and insults me, and I have not the courage to rebuke her. To-day I went
      almost wild with fury&mdash;I rushed into the bathroom and locked the door
      and flung myself upon the floor. I found myself gnawing at the rug in my
      rage&mdash;I mean that literally. That is what life has left for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you you must take me away, we must get out of this fiendish city.
      Let us go into the wilderness as you said, and live as we can&mdash;I
      would rather starve to death than face these things. Let us get into the
      country, Thyrsis. You can work as a farm-hand, and earn a few dollars a
      week&mdash;surely that could not be a greater strain upon us than the way
      things are now."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thyrsis received this, he racked his brains once more; and then he
      sat down and wrote a letter to Barry Creston. He told how he had worked
      over the play, and how it had gone to ruin; he told of his present plight.
      He knew, he said, that Mr. Creston had been interested in the play, and
      that he was a man understood the needs of the artist-life. Would he lend
      two hundred dollars, which would suffice until Thyrsis could get another
      work completed?
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a week for a reply to this; and when it arrived he opened it
      with trembling fingers. He half expected a check to fall fluttering to the
      floor; but alas, there was not a single flutter. "I have read your
      letter," wrote the young prince, "and I have considered the matter
      carefully. I would do what you ask, were it not for my conviction that it
      would not be a good thing for you. It seems to me the testimony of all
      experience, that artists do their great work under the spur of necessity.
      I do not believe that real art can ever be subsidized. It is for men that
      you are writing; and you must find out how to make men hear you. You may
      not thank me for this now, but some day you will, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      After duly pondering which communication, Thyrsis racked his wits, and
      bethought him of yet another person to try. He sat himself down and
      addressed Mr. Robertson Jones. He explained that he was in this cruel
      plight, owing to his having devoted so many months to "The Genius." Even
      the actors had received something for the performances of the play they
      had given; but the author had received nothing at all. He asked Mr. Jones
      for a personal loan to help him in a great emergency; and he promised to
      repay it at the earliest possible moment. To which Mr. Jones made this
      reply&mdash;"Inasmuch as the failure of the play was due solely to your
      own obstinacy, it seems to me that your present experiences are affording
      exactly the discipline you need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. However, there are many ups and downs in the trade of free-lance
      writer. The very day after he had received this letter, there came, in
      quick succession two bursts of sunlight through the clouds of Thyrsis'
      despair. The first was a letter, written in a quaint script, from a man
      who explained that he was interested in a "Free People's Theatre" in one
      of the cities of Germany. "You will please to accept my congratulations,"
      he wrote; "I had never known such a play as yours in America to be
      written. I should greatly be pleased to translate the play, so that it
      might be known in Germany. Our compensation would have to be little, as
      you will understand; but of appreciation I think you may receive much in
      the Fatherland."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Thyrsis sent a cordial response, saying that he would be glad of
      any remuneration, and enclosing a copy of the manuscript of "The Genius".
      And then&mdash;only two days later&mdash;came the other event, a still
      more notable one; a letter from the publisher who had been number
      thirty-seven on the list of "The Hearer of Truth". Thyrsis had got so
      discouraged about this work that he now sent it about as a matter of
      routine, and without thinking of it at all. Great, therefore, was his
      amazement when he opened the letter and read that this publisher was
      disposed to undertake it, and would be glad to see him and talk over
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went, speculating on the way as to what strange manner of being
      this publisher might be. The solution of the mystery he found was that the
      publisher was new at the business, and had entrusted his "literary
      department" to a very young man who had enthusiasms. The young man held
      his position for only a month or two; but in that month or two Thyrsis got
      in his "innings".
    </p>
    <p>
      The publisher wished to bring the book out that spring. He offered a ten
      per cent royalty, and the trembling author summoned the courage to ask for
      one hundred dollars advance; when he got it, he was divided between his
      delight, and a sneaking regret that he had not tried for a hundred and
      fifty!
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day came the contracts and the money; Thyrsis marvelled at
      the fact that there were people who could sign checks for a hundred
      dollars, and apparently not mind it in the least. With the money he was
      able to pay all his debts, and also a bill which Corydon had received from
      a "specialist" who had been treating her. This was a new habit that
      Corydon was developing, as a result of headaches and backaches and other
      obscure miseries. These amiable "specialists" permitted one to run up a
      bill with them; and so, whenever Thyrsis made a new "strike", there were
      always debts to eat up the greater part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now another hope to lure them; new proofs to read, and in due
      time, new reviews. But it would be fall before they could expect more
      money from the book, and meantime there was still the problem of the
      summer. So, as usual, Thyrsis was plotting and planning, groping about him
      and trying one desperate scheme after another; his head was like a busy
      workshop, from which came every hour new plans, new expedients, new
      experiments. And meanwhile, of course, deep down in his soul there was
      forming the new work, that some day would emerge and take possession of
      him, driving everything else from his consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      People would repeat to him, over and over, their dreary formula&mdash;"Get
      a position! Get a position!" And patiently, unwearyingly, Thyrsis would
      set himself to explain to them what it was like to be inspired. It was not
      perversity upon his part, it was not conceit; it was no more these than it
      was laziness. It was something that was in him&mdash;something that he had
      not put there himself, something that he could not take out of himself; a
      thing that took possession of him, without any intention upon his part,
      without any permission; a thing that required him to do certain acts, and
      that tore him to pieces if he did not do them. And how should he be blamed
      because he could not do as other men&mdash;because he could not take care
      of himself, nor even of his wife and child? Because he could not have any
      rights, because he could not possess the luxuries of manhood and
      self-respect? Because, in short, he was cast out into the gutter for every
      dog to snarl at and for every loafer to spurn? Could it be that in this
      whole civilization, with its wealth and power, its culture and learning,
      its sciences and arts and religions&mdash;there was not to be found one
      single man or woman who could recognize such a state of affairs, and
      realize what it meant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. About this time Thyrsis thought of another plan. Perhaps he might
      get some one to publish the play in book form&mdash;that would bring him a
      little money, and possibly also it might help him to interest some other
      manager or actor. So he took the manuscript to his friend Mr. Ardsley, who
      told him it would not sell, and then gave him another lecture upon his
      folly in not having written the "practical" novel; and then he took it to
      the publisher for whom Prof. Osborne acted as reader. So he had another
      conference with that representative of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get him some day," Thyrsis had said to himself, after their last
      interview; and he found that he had almost "got" him now. There was no
      chance of the play's selling, said the professor, and therefore no
      recommending it for publication; but it was indeed a remarkable piece of
      work&mdash;one might possibly say that it was a <i>great</i> piece of
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the author responded, "Why can't one say that surely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite sure," said the other, "whether your violinist is a genius,
      or only thinks he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis pondered this. "That's rather an important question," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," admitted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ought to be some way of deciding such a question definitely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there isn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I'm afraid there isn't. We know too little about genius as yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, professor," said Thyrsis, "you are a critic&mdash;you write books of
      criticism. And that's the one question a critic has to answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," said Prof. Osborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, when you face the issue, you give up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has generally taken a long time to decide such a matter," was the
      professor's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it has," said the other; "and meantime the man is starved out."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "You have never had any such experience yourself?"
      asked Thyrsis. "Of inspiration, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," was the answer. "I couldn't pretend to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So your judgments are never from first-hand knowledge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor hesitated. "I am dealing with you frankly&mdash;-" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Thyrsis, "and I appreciate that. You understand that it's
      an important point for me to get clear. I've felt that all along about you&mdash;I've
      felt it about so many others who set themselves against me. And yet I have
      to bear the burden of their condemnation&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never condemned you," interposed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you did!" cried Thyrsis. "You told me that I knew less about
      writing than anyone in your class! And you spoke as one who had
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you had given no indications in the class-room&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know! I know! I tried to get you to see the reason. I wanted to create
      literature; and you set me down with a lot of formulas&mdash;you told me
      to write about 'The Duty of the College Man to Support Athletics!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's difficult to see," began Prof. Osborne, "how we could teach college
      boys to create literature&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least," said the other, "you need not follow a method which would make
      it impossible for one of them to create literature if he had it in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it seem to you as bad as that?" asked the professor, a little
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It truly does," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what would you say we could do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the boy replied, "You might try to get your pupils to feel one
      deep emotion about life, or to think one worth-while thought; then they
      might stand a chance of knowing how it feels to write."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. Thyrsis was still reading in the papers and magazines of
      philanthropists and public-spirited citizens; and he was still sitting
      down to write them and explain his plight. He would beg them to believe
      that he wanted nothing but a bare living; and he would send copies of his
      books or articles or manuscripts, and ask these people to read them. And
      about this time an unusual thing happened&mdash;one of these
      philanthropists answered his letter. He wrote that he did not agree with
      Thyrsis' ideas, by any means, but appreciated the power of his writing,
      and was certain that he had a career before him. Whereupon Thyrsis made
      haste to follow up his advantage, and wrote another letter&mdash;one of
      the most intense and impassioned that he ever composed in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told about the new book he was dreaming. For years he had read his
      country's history, and lived in it and thrilled with it. Especially had he
      read the Civil War; and now he was planning a book that should hold the
      War, and all the meanings of the War, as a wine-cup holds the rich flavors
      and aromas of the grape. A titan struggle it had been, the birth-agony of
      a nation; and it was a thing to be contemplated with amazement, that it
      should have produced so little in the way of art. Half a dozen poems there
      were; but of novels not one above the grade of juvenile fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Thyrsis was planning was a new form; a series of swift visions, of
      glimpses into the very heart of the nation's agony. He described some of
      the scenes that were haunting him and driving him. The winter's night in
      the ditches in front of Marye's Heights, when the dead and dying lay piled
      in windrows, and the soul of a people sobbed in despair! The night on the
      field of Gettysburg, when the young soldier lay wounded, but rapt in his
      vision, seeing the hosts of the victorious future defiling upon that
      hallowed ground! The ghastly scenes in Andersonville, and the escape, and
      the long journey filled with perils; and the siege of Petersburg, and the
      surrender; and last of all the ecstasy of the dying man in the capital,
      when the grim, war-worn legions were tramping for two days through the
      city. Such, wrote Thyrsis, was the book that he wished to compose, and
      that was being stifled in him for the lack of two or three hundred
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the receipt of this letter the philanthropist wrote again, suggesting
      that the poet come to see him and talk things over. He sent the price of a
      railroad ticket to Boston; and so Thyrsis made the acquaintance of a new
      world&mdash;one might almost say of a whole new system of worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For here was the Athens of America, the hub of the universe. In Boston
      they worshipped culture, they lived in literature and art and the
      transcendental excellences; and by the way of showing that there was no
      snobbery in them, they opened the gates of their most august mansions to
      this soul-sick poet, and invited him to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis got a strange impression among these people, who were living upon
      their knees before the shrine of their own literary history. One was
      treading here upon holy ground; in these very houses had dwelt immortal
      writers&mdash;their earthly forms had rested in these chairs, and their
      auras yet haunted the dim religious light of these drawing-rooms. There
      were old people who had known them in the flesh, and could tell anecdotes
      about them&mdash;to which one listened in reverent awe; at every gathering
      one met people who were writing biographies and memoirs of them, or
      editing their letters and journals, or writing essays and appreciations,
      criticisms and commentaries and catalogs and bibliographies. And to be
      worthy of the visitations of such hallowed influences, one must guard
      one's mind as a temple, a place of silences and serenities, to which no
      vulgar things could penetrate; one excluded all the uproar of these days
      of undisciplined egotism&mdash;above all things else one preserved an
      attitude of aloofness from that which presumed to call itself "literature"
      in such degenerate times.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have become acquainted with these high standards was perhaps worth the
      rent of a room and the cost of some food and clean collars. So Thyrsis
      reflected when, after his week of waiting, he had his interview with the
      benevolent philanthropist, who explained to him, at great length, how
      charity had the effect of weakening the springs of character, and
      destroying those qualities of self-reliance and independence which were
      the most precious things in a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. It was a curious coincidence, one that seemed almost symbolic&mdash;that
      Thyrsis should have gone from the Brahmins of Boston to the Socialists of
      the East Side!
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the publishing-houses he visited, Thyrsis had met a young man
      who gave him a Socialist magazine to read; as the magazine was published
      in the next building, Thyrsis went in and met the editor. About this time
      they were crowning a new king in England, and Thyrsis, who had no use for
      kings, wrote a sarcastic poem which the Socialist editor published free of
      charge. And so the boy discovered a new way in which he could relieve his
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see what you want," he admitted, in his arguments with this editor;
      "and it's the same thing as I want&mdash;every man with any sense must see
      that, in the ultimate outcome, all this capital will be owned by the
      public and not by private individuals. But what I object to is the way you
      go at it. The industrial process is a necessary thing; it is drilling and
      disciplining the workers. They are not yet fitted for the responsibility
      of managing the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," asked the editor, "what's to be the sign when they <i>are</i>
      fitted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they have been educated," Thyrsis answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the editor responded, "Who is to educate them, if we don't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was an interesting point; and Thyrsis found little by little that a
      new light was dawning upon him. He had somehow conceived of industrial
      evolution as something vast and intangible and mechanical, something that
      went on independent of men, and that could not be hurried or delayed. What
      this editor pointed out was that the process was a definite one, that it
      went on in the minds of men, and involved human effort&mdash;of which the
      publishing of Socialist literature was a most essential part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to hear Darrell," said the man; and a few days later he wrote
      Thyrsis a note, asking him to go to a hall over on the East Side that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went, and found a working-men's meeting-room, ill-lighted and
      ill-ventilated, with perhaps two hundred people in it. The chairman
      introduced the speaker of the evening; and so Thyrsis got his first
      glimpse of Henry Darrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was something over forty years of age, slight of build; his face was
      pale to the point of ghostliness, and this impression was heightened by a
      jet black mustache and beard. One's first thought was that this man was no
      stranger to suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a good speaker, in the conventional sense, he fumbled for
      words, and repeated himself&mdash;and yet from his first sentence Thyrsis
      found himself listening spellbound. The voice went through him like the
      toll of a bell; never in all his life had he heard a speaker who put such
      a burden of anguish into his words&mdash;who gave such a sense of gigantic
      issues, of age-long destinies hanging in the balance, of world-embracing
      hopes and powers struggling to be born. Here was a prophet who carried in
      his soul the future of the race; who in the sudden flashes of his vision,
      in the swift rushes of his passionate pleadings, evoked from the deeps of
      the consciousness forces that one contemplated with terror&mdash;confronted
      one with martyrdoms and agonies and despairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revolution" was his title; he pictured modern civilization as it
      presented itself to the proletarian man&mdash;a gigantic Moloch, to which
      human lives were fed, a monster from whose dominion there was no
      deliverance, even in the uttermost parts of the earth. He pictured
      accident, disease and death, unemployment and starvation, child-labor,
      prostitution, war; he was the voice of the dispossessed of the earth, the
      man beneath the machine, ground up body, mind and soul in this "world-wide
      mill of economic might". And he showed how this man dragged down with him
      all society; how the chain that bound the slave was fastened also to the
      master&mdash;so that from the poverty and oppression and degradation of
      this "downmost man" came all the ulcers that festered in the social body.
      He saw the great economic machine grinding on day and night, the mighty
      forces rushing to their culmination. He saw the toiling millions pressed
      deeper and deeper into the mire; he saw their blind, convulsive struggles
      for deliverance; he saw over them the gigantic slave-driver with his
      thousand-lashed whip&mdash;the capitalist state, class-owned
      class-administered&mdash;backed by the capitalist church and the
      capitalist press and capitalist "public sentiment". So the hopes of the
      people went down in blood and reaction sat enthroned. The nations, ridden
      by despotisms, and whirled into senseless wars, ran the old course of
      militarism, imperialism, barbarism; and so civilization slid back yet
      again into the melting-pot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had never heard such a speech as this in his life. When it was
      over, he went up to the platform where Darrell sat, looking more exhausted
      and pain-driven than ever; and in a few hesitating words he told of his
      interest, and asked for the speaker's address, that he might write to him.
      And that night he posted a letter, introducing himself as a young writer,
      who felt impelled to learn more about Darrell's ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply came a note from the other, asking him to dine with him; and
      Thyrsis answered accepting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as chance would have it, he mentioned the circumstance to his
      mother. "Darrell!" she cried. "You don't mean Henry Darrell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you would meet that man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" he asked, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you read anything about him in the papers? That monster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who deserted his wife and children, and left them to starve, and
      ran away with some rich woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis recollected vaguely some sensational headlines, about the
      clergyman and college professor who had done the shocking things his
      mother spoke of, and was now a social outcast, and a preacher of anarchy
      and revolution. He recalled also that there had been a woman, beautiful
      and richly-dressed, with Darrell at the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was not disturbed by all this, for he had long ago made up his
      mind that every man had to work out his own sex-problems; in fact, his
      first impulse was to admire a man who had had the courage to face the
      world upon such an issue. But he was sorry he had mentioned it to his
      mother, for she wept bitterly when she found that he meant to accept the
      invitation. That was the culmination of her life's defeat&mdash;that her
      son, who had been designed for a bishop, should be going to sit at table
      with Henry Darrell and his paramour!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Thyrsis went to the apartment-hotel where Darrell lived, and was
      introduced to the beautiful lady as Mrs. Darrell, and they went down to
      the dining-room&mdash;where he noticed that everyone turned to stare at
      them as they entered. It made him feel that he must be doing something
      quite desperate; and yet it was not easy to imagine any wickedness of the
      man opposite to him&mdash;his voice was so kind, and his smile so gentle,
      and his whole aspect so appealing. He was dressed in black, and wore a
      soft black bow at his throat, which made still more conspicuous the pallor
      of his face; Thyrsis had never met a man he took to more quickly&mdash;there
      was something about him that was like a little child, calling for
      affection and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, also, there was the mind of a thinker. He was a man of culture, in
      the most vital sense of the word; he had swept the heavens of thought with
      a powerful telescope&mdash;had travelled, and knew many languages, and
      their literatures and arts. He had tested them all by a strong acid of his
      own; so that to talk with him was to discover the feet of clay of one's
      idols.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of Dante and Angelo, who were two of his heroes; he told of great
      experiences among the latter's titan frescos. He spoke of Mazzini, whose
      greatness as a writer the world had yet to appreciate; he spoke also of
      Wagner, whose music he valued less than his critical and polemical work.
      He told of modern artists both in Germany and Italy&mdash;revolutionary
      forces of whom Thyrsis had never heard at all. The day must come, said
      Darrell, when Americans would discover the great movements of contemporary
      thought, and realize their own provincialness. America thought of itself
      as "the land of the free", and that made it hard to teach. It was obvious
      enough that there had never been any real freedom in America&mdash;only
      government by propertied classes. The Revolution had been a rebellion of
      country gentlemen and city merchants; as one might know from the
      "constitution" they had adopted&mdash;one of the greatest barriers to
      human progress ever devised. And so with the Civil War, which to Darrell
      was one of the deeds of the newly-risen monster of Capitalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs again, and Thyrsis found another man seated in the
      drawing-room. He was introduced by the name of Paret, and Thyrsis
      recognized him as the editor of "The Beacon", a magazine of which he had
      chanced upon a copy some time before. It was the first Socialist
      publication he had ever seen, and it had repelled him because its editor
      had printed his own picture in a conspicuous place, and also because in
      his leading editorial he had dealt flippantly with an eminent reformer and
      philanthropist for whom Thyrsis had a profound respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here was the editor himself&mdash;not merely his photograph: a little
      man, clad in evening dress, very neat and dapper. He had a black beard,
      trimmed to a point, and also a sarcastic smile, and he impressed Thyrsis
      as a drawing-room edition of Mephistopheles. He lounged at ease in a big
      chair, not troubling to talk; save that every now and then he would
      punctuate the discussion with some droll reflection that stuck in one's
      mind like a burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one spoke of certain evangelists who were conducting a temperance
      campaign among the workers in the steel-mills. Said Paret: "If I had to
      live in hell, I'm sure I'd rather be drunk than sober!" And a little later
      Thyrsis spoke of a novel he had been reading, which set out to solve the
      problem of "capital and labor". Its solution seemed to be for the handsome
      young leader of the union to marry the daughter of the capitalist; and
      Paret remarked, with his dry smile, "No doubt if the capitalists and their
      daughters are willing, the union-leaders will come to the scratch." Again,
      Darrell was telling about the ten years' struggle he had waged to waken
      the Church to the great issue of the time; and how at last he had given up
      in despair. Paret remarked, "For my part, I never try to talk economics
      with preachers. When you talk to a business-man, he understands a business
      proposition, and you can get somewhere; but when you talk with a preacher,
      and you think he's been understanding you, you find that all the time he's
      been thinking what Moses would have said about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There came other guests: a German, hard-fisted, bullet-headed&mdash;editor
      of an East Side labor-paper. Some one spoke of working-men losing their
      votes through being unemployed and cast adrift; and Thyrsis remembered
      this man's grim comment, "They lose their votes, but they don't lose their
      voices!" There came a young man, fair as an Antinous, who with his verbal
      battering-ram shook the institutions of society so as to frighten even the
      author of "The Higher Cannibalism". There came also a poetess, whose work
      he had seen in the magazines, and with her a Russian youth who had come to
      study the thought of America, and was now going home, because America had
      no thought. Thyrsis had a good deal of patriotism left in him, and might
      have been angered by this stripling's contempt; but the stripling spoke
      with such quiet assurance, and his contempt was so boundless as to
      frighten one. "These people," he said&mdash;"they simply do not know what
      the intellectual life means!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thyrsis went home that evening, he carried with him new ideas to
      ponder; also some of Darrell's pamphlets and speeches&mdash;the product of
      his ten years' struggle to make the teachings of Christ of some authority
      in the Christian Church. Thyrsis sat up late, and read one of these
      pamphlets, an indictment of Capitalism from the point of view of the
      artist and spiritual creator. It was a magnificent piece of writing; it
      came to Thyrsis like an echo out of his own life. So, before he slept that
      night he had written a letter to Darrell, telling of his struggles and his
      defeats. "I do not ask you to help <i>me</i>" he wrote. "I ask you to read
      my work, and decide if that be worth saving. For ashamed as I am to say
      it, I am at the end of my resources, and if some help does not come, I do
      not know what will become of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had now tried all varieties of the great and successful of the
      earth&mdash;the publishers and editors and authors, the college professors
      and clergymen, the statesmen and capitalists and philanthropists. And now,
      for the first time, he tried the Socialists. He trembled when he opened
      Darrell's reply. Could it be that this man would be like all the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, he was different! "Dear Brother:" he wrote. "I understand what you
      have told me, and I appreciate your position. Send me your manuscripts at
      once; I leave to-morrow for a lecture-trip, and on my way I will read
      everything, and let you hear from me on my return. In the meantime, I
      should add that I am helping two Socialist publications, and a good many
      individuals too, and that my resources have been absurdly exaggerated in
      the public prints. I say this, that you may not overestimate what I might
      possibly be able to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. So Thyrsis sent a manuscript of his play, and a copy of his
      first novel, and a set of proofs of "The Hearer of Truth"; and then for a
      couple of weeks he waited in suspense and dread. He could not see how a
      man like Henry Darrell could fail to appreciate his work; but on the other
      hand, after so many disappointments and rebuffs, how could he bring
      himself to believe that any one would really give him aid?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came a second letter; a letter full of warm-hearted sympathy&mdash;pointing
      out the faults of immaturity in his work, but also recognizing its real
      merits. It closed with this all-important sentence: "I will do what I can
      to help you, so come and let us talk it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went; and as they sat in his study, Darrell put his arm about him,
      and told him a little of his own career. He had begun life as a
      street-waif, a newsboy and bootblack; and once when he was ill, he had
      gone to a drug-store for help, and the druggist had given him a poison by
      mistake, so that all his life thereafter he had more sick days than well.
      He told how, at an early age, he had gone to a country college to seek an
      education as a divinity-student; he had arrived, weary and footsore, and
      with his last cent had bought a post-card to let his mother know that he
      was safe He told how, as a clergyman and college professor the gospel of
      the time had come to him; how he had preached and labored, amid
      persecution and obloquy, until he had come to realize that the Church was
      a dead sepulchre; and how at last he had thrown everything to the winds,
      and given himself to the working-class political movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyrsis, scrupulous as ever, said, "I know nothing about Socialism. I
      mean to study it; but I might not come to believe in it&mdash;how can I
      tell? I would not want you to help me under any misapprehension."
    </p>
    <p>
      At which the other smiled gently. "I am working for the truth," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about Thyrsis and his needs. Presumably, he said, he would
      have money from his new book in the fall, but meantime he wanted to take
      his family into the country. He could live on thirty dollars a month; it
      would be a matter of some two hundred and fifty dollars. Darrell said he
      would give him this; and Thyrsis sat there, powerless to thank him, his
      voice trembling, and a mist of tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell his friend of the work that he meant to do. Darrell had
      said that to him the Civil War was a crime; but Thyrsis did not know what
      he meant by that. "I believe in my country!" he said. "It has tried for
      high things&mdash;and it will come to them! I know that it can be thrilled
      and roused, and made to see the shame into which it is fallen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Darrell pressed his arm, and answered, with a smile, "I won't argue with
      you about the War; you go ahead and write your book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went home to Corydon, as one who brings a reprieve to a
      prisoner under sentence of death. Such a deliverance as it was to them!
      And such transports of relief and gratitude as they experienced! He sang
      the praises of Darrell, and of the new friends he had made at Darrell's;
      also he brought an invitation for Corydon to come with him to an evening
      reception the next week. They were anxious to meet her, he said; and
      Corydon was anxious to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas, this did not work out according to expectations. Thyrsis
      discovered now what his wife had meant when she wrote that suffering and
      humiliation were breaking down her character. She could not bear to meet
      intellectual people, to take part in the competition of their life. For
      the most part these were men and women of intense personalities, absorbed
      in their own ideas, keenly critical, and not very merciful to any sort of
      weakness. And Corydon was morbidly aware of her own lack of
      accomplishments, and acutely sensitive as to what others thought about
      her. A strange figure she must have made in any one's drawing-room&mdash;with
      the old dress she had fixed up, and the lace-collar she had borrowed for
      the occasion, and the sad face with the large dark eyes. The talk of the
      company ran to politics; and Corydon had nothing to say about politics.
      She could only sit in a corner while Thyrsis talked, and suffer agonies of
      humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make matters worse, there came a literary lion that evening; one of the
      few modern writers whose books Corydon knew and loved. But when they were
      introduced, he scarcely looked at her; he went on talking to an East Side
      poetess whose opinions were fluent and ready. So Corydon found herself
      shunted into a corner with an unknown old lady. It was one of Corydon's
      peculiarities that she abhorred old ladies; and this one questioned her
      about the feeding of infants and told her that she was ill-equipped for
      the responsibilities of motherhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way home she poured out her bitterness to Thyrsis. "I can see
      exactly how it is," she said. "They all think you've married a pretty
      face!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't given them much chance to think otherwise," he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't want any chance," she exclaimed. "They've got it all settled!
      You are the rising light, which is to astonish the world&mdash;and I'm
      your youthful blunder. I stay at home and take care of the baby, and they
      all feel sorry for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want them to feel sorry for <i>you?</i>" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Corydon answered, "I don't want them to know about me at all. I
      want to get away, and stay by myself, and get back my self-respect." And
      so it was decided that in a couple of weeks more&mdash;the first of April&mdash;they
      would shake the dust of the city from their feet. They sent for their tent
      and other goods, and began inquiring about a place to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. A few days more passed; and then, one Sundav morning, Thyrsis'
      mother came to him in tears, with a copy of a newspaper
      "magazine-supplement" in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at this!" she cried; and Thyrsis stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a full-page article, with many illustrations, and a headline two
      inches deep&mdash;"Henry Darrell to found Free-Love Colony! Ex-college
      professor and clergyman buys farm to teach his doctrines." There was a
      picture of Darrell, standing upon a ladder and nailing up an announcement
      of his defiance to the institution of marriage; and there were pictures of
      his wife and child, and of the farm he had bought, and a long account of
      the colony which he was organizing, and in which he meant to preach and
      practice his ideas of "free love".
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was half dazed. "I don't believe it!" he cried; whereat his mother
      wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not believe it!" she exclaimed. "Why, the paper even gives the price he
      paid for the place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis took the article and went to see Henry Darrell again; and there
      followed one of the most painful experiences of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his friend like a man blasted by a stroke of lightning. His very
      physical appearance was altered; his voice shook and his eyes were wild,
      and he paced the room, his whole aspect one cry of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed Thyrsis to a lot of clippings that lay upon the table&mdash;the
      first editorial comments upon this new pronouncement. There was one from
      an evening paper, which had close upon a million circulation, and had
      devoted its whole editorial page to a scathing denunciation, in which it
      was declared that "Prof. Darrell's morality is that of the higher apes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of it!" the man cried. "And the thing will go from one end of the
      country to the other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But"&mdash;gasped Thyrsis, bewildered&mdash;"then it is not true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True?" cried Darrell. "True? How can you ask me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;the colony! What is it to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not going to be any colony. I never dreamed of such a thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And haven't you bought any farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife bought a farm, over a year ago&mdash;because we wanted to live in
      the country!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," gasped Thyrsis&mdash;"how dare they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They dare anything with me!" cried the other. "<i>Anything!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you no redress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Redress? What redress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell Thyrsis what had happened. He and Mrs. Darrell had gone
      down to the farm to see about getting it ready, and a woman had come,
      representing that she wished to write a magazine article about "the
      country-homes of literary Americans". Upon this pretext she had secured a
      photograph of the place, and of Darrell, and of his wife and child. She
      had even attempted to secure a photograph of his wife's aged mother, who
      lived with her, and who was involved in the affair because the money
      belonged to her. Then the woman had gone away&mdash;and a couple of weeks
      later had come this!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I thought they were through with us!" Darrell whispered, with a
      shudder. "I thought it was all over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in a chair, with his face hid in his arms. Thyrsis put his hand
      upon his shoulder, and the man caught it. "Listen," he exclaimed. "You can
      see this thing from the outside, you know the literary world. Do you think
      that I can ever rise above this? Is there any use in trying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" Thyrsis asked, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;is it worth while for me to go on writing? Can I ever have
      any influence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was shocked at the question&mdash;as he had been at the way
      Darrell took the whole thing. He knew that his friend had money enough to
      live comfortably; and why should any sort of criticism matter to a man who
      was economically free?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother," he said, "you have forgotten your Dante."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Segui il tuo corso e lascia dir le gente!</i>" quoted Thyrsis; and
      then he added, "You don't seem to realize that these are newspapers, and
      nobody really credits them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but they do!" cried Darrell. "You don't know what I have been through
      with! My oldest friends have cut me! Clergymen have refused to sit at
      table with me! The organization that I gave ten years of my life to
      founding has gone all to pieces. I have been utterly ruined&mdash;I have
      been wiped out, destroyed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear man," Thyrsis argued, "you are setting out to teach a new
      doctrine, one that is abhorrent to people. And how can you expect to avoid
      being attacked? It seems to me that either you ought not to have done it,
      or else been prepared for some of this uproar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But because a man becomes a Socialist, are they to libel him in these
      foul ways?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean that. It's not only that you are a Socialist, but that you
      have defied their marriage-laws."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I haven't!" exclaimed Darrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" asked Thyrsis, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have defied no law&mdash;nor even any convention. I have done
      everything that the world requires."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis stared at him, amazed. "Why, surely," he gasped, "you and&mdash;and
      Mrs. Darrell&mdash;you are not <i>married?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married!" exclaimed the other. "We were married here in New York, by a
      regularly-ordained clergyman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis could not find words to express his dismay. "I&mdash;I had no idea
      of that!" he gasped. "I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see the lies!" cried the other. "Even <i>you</i> had swallowed them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Thyrsis some time to adjust himself to this new point of view. He
      had thought of his friend as a man who had boldly defied the convention of
      marriage; and instead of that he was apparently a man cowering under the
      lash of the world's undeserved rage. But if so&mdash;what an amazing and
      incredible thing was the mesh of slander and falsehood in which he had
      been entangled!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. Little by little Thyrsis drew from Darrell the story of his
      marital experience. Before he had been of age, as a poor student, he had
      boarded with a woman many years his senior, who had set out to lure him
      into marrying her. "I don't believe that she ever loved me one hour," he
      said. "She had made up her mind that I was a man of brilliant parts, and
      that I would have worldly success. To me the thing was like an evil dream&mdash;I
      couldn't realize it. And I can't tell you about it now&mdash;it was too
      horrible. She was older than I, and so different&mdash;she was more like a
      man. And for twenty years she held me; I had to stay&mdash;I was utterly
      at her mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's voice fell to a whisper, and he pressed Thyrsis' hand
      convulsively; there were tears upon his cheeks. "I could not tell it all
      to anyone," he said. "It makes me cry like a child to think of it. I'm
      only getting over it little by little&mdash;realizing how I was tortured.
      This woman had no interest in me, intellectual or spiritual; she brought
      up my children to despise me. I would stay upstairs in my study, writing
      sermons&mdash;that was all my life! For twenty years I waded through my
      own blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Darrell paused to get control of himself, and then went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of my parishioners was my present wife's mother. She was one of the
      old-time abolitionists, and she was wealthy; and now, in her old age, she
      saw the new light, and became a Socialist. This, of course, was like gall
      to her family; they were powers in the state&mdash;the railroad people,
      who control the legislature and run the government. And so their
      newspapers denounced me, and denounced the university where I taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then came her daughter&mdash;a young girl out of college. I was at their
      home often, and we became friends. She saw how unhappy I was, and she
      tried to open my wife's eyes, and to win her over to me. But, of course,
      she failed in that; and then, little by little we found that we loved each
      other. You know me&mdash;you know that I am not a base man, nor a careless
      man; and you will believe me when I tell you that there was nothing
      between us that the world could have called wrong. We knew that we loved,
      and we knew that there was no hope. And that went on for eight years; for
      eight years I renounced&mdash;and strove with every power of my heart and
      soul to make something out of that renunciation, to transmute it into
      spiritual power. And I failed&mdash;I could not do it; and in the end I
      knew the reason. It was not beauty and nobility&mdash;it was madness and
      horror; it was not life&mdash;it was death! The time came when I knew that
      our renunciation was simply a crime against the soul. Can you see what I
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Thyrsis, "I can see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And see what that meant to me&mdash;the situation I faced! I was a
      clergyman&mdash;and preaching a new crusade to the world. It was like
      being in a cage, with bars of red-hot metal. A hundred times I would go
      towards them&mdash;and a hundred times I would shrink back. But I had to
      grasp them in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see!" whispered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing was becoming a scandal anyway; the world was bound to make a
      scandal of it, whether we would or no. It was a scandal that I visited in
      another woman's home, it was a scandal that I spent her money in my
      propaganda. The very children on the streets would taunt my children about
      it. And then, my health broke down from overwork; and the mother was going
      abroad, and she invited me to go with her and her daughter; and, of
      course, that made it worse. So at last the old lady came to me. 'You love
      my daughter,' she said, 'and the world has thrown her into your arms. You
      must let a divorce be arranged, and then marry my daughter.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you got the divorce yourself?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Darrell. "There were grounds enough; but it would have meant to
      attack my wife in the public prints, and I would not do it. I had to let
      her charge me with desertion, and say nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, of course, they distorted that," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They distorted everything!" cried the other. "My present wife gave my
      first wife all her patrimony; and I thought that was generous&mdash;I
      thought it was a proof of love. But the newspapers made it that she had
      bought me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they distorted your second marriage?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They lied about it deliberately," was Darrell's reply&mdash;"Some of our
      friends gave little addresses of greeting; and so the newspapers called it
      a new kind of wedding&mdash;a 'Socialist wedding', which we had designed
      for our new kind of unions! And now, when we buy a farm, so that we can
      live quietly in the country, they turn that into a 'free love colony'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13. Thyrsis went away from this interview with some new problems to
      ponder upon. He had seen a little of this power of the newspapers to
      defile and torment a man; but he had never dreamed of anything as bad as
      this. This was murderous, this was monstrous. He saw these papers now as
      gigantic engines of exploitation and oppression&mdash;irresponsible,
      unscrupulous, wanton&mdash;turned loose in society to crush and destroy
      whom they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had taken this man Darrell and they had poured out their poisons upon
      him; they had tortured him hideously, they had burned him up as with
      vitriol. As a public force he was no longer a human being at all&mdash;he
      was a deformity, a spectre conjured up to bring fright to the beholder.
      And through it all he was utterly helpless&mdash;as much at their mercy as
      an infant in the hands of savages. And what had he done? Why had the
      torture been visited upon him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis pictured the men who had led in this soul-hunt. They were supposed
      to be enlightened Americans at the dawn of the twentieth century; and did
      they truly hold to the superstition of marriage as a religious sacrament,
      not to be dissolved by mortal power? Did they really believe that a man
      who had once been drawn into matrimony was obligated for life&mdash;no
      matter how unhappy he might be, no matter to what indignities he might be
      subjected? Or, if they did recognize the permissibility of divorce&mdash;then
      why this hue and cry after Darrell, who had borne his punishment for
      twenty years, and had waited for eight or ten years to test the depths of
      his new love?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question answered itself; and the answer fanned Thyrsis' soul into a
      blaze of indignation. All this patter about the deserted wife, sitting at
      home with her children and weeping her eyes out&mdash;all that was so much
      hocus-pocus for the ears of the mob. The chiefs of this Inquisition and
      their torturers and slaves wrote it with their tongues in their cheeks.
      What they saw was that they had got securely strapped upon their rack the
      man who had threatened their power, who had laid bare its sources and
      exposed its iniquity. And they meant that if ever he came out of their
      torture-chamber, it should be so mangled and crippled that never again
      would he lift a finger against them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The gist of the "Darrell case", when you got right down to it, was a
      quarrel over property; it was the snarling of wolves who had been
      disturbed at their feeding. Darrell had denounced wealth and the
      exploiters of wealth, and now he had married a woman of wealth; and was he
      to get away with his prize? That was the meaning of all the loud halloo&mdash;for
      that the hounds were unleashed and the hunting-horns sounded. Thyrsis
      pictured the men who "wrote up" the Darrell story. He had known them in
      the newspaper-world&mdash;the servants of the giant publicity-machine;
      living and working in the roar and rush of it, in a stifling atmosphere
      where the finer qualities of the soul were poisoned and withered over
      night. They lived their lives, almost without exception, by means of
      alcohol and coffee and tobacco; they were scornful, disillusioned, cynical
      beyond all telling and all belief. Their only god in heaven or earth or
      the waters under the earth was "copy". To such men there were two possible
      bonds of interest in a woman&mdash;the first being lust, and the second
      money. In the case of Henry Darrell they found both these motives; and so
      how clear the story was to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis thought, also, of the men who owned and managed the papers; those
      who had turned loose the hunt and directed it. Rich men were they, who had
      built these publicity machines for their own purposes. And what were they
      in their private lives? Some of them were notoriously dissolute; and still
      others hid their ways under a veil of hypocrisy&mdash;just as in their
      editorials they hid their class-interests under pretenses of principle.
      And how easy it would have been for Darrell to get what he wanted without
      losing his reputation&mdash;if only he had been willing to follow the
      example of these eminent citizens! Thyrsis knew one man, the editor of an
      appallingly respectable journal, who had invited a young girl to his
      wife's home and there attempted to seduce her. He knew the proprietor of
      another, whose cheerful custom it was to go about among his newly-married
      women-friends and suggest that, inasmuch as he was a "superman," and their
      husbands were weaklings, they should let him become in secret the father
      of their children. This amateur eugenist was accustomed to maintain that
      the great men in history had for the most part been bastards; and Thyrsis,
      knowing this fact about him, would read editorials in his papers, in which
      Henry Darrell was denounced as an enemy of the home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Thyrsis was reading Darrell's books and pamphlets, and coming to
      realize what a mind was here being destroyed. For this man, it seemed to
      him, was master of the noblest prose utterance that had been heard in
      America since Emerson died. He went again to hear him speak, in another
      ill-lighted and stuffy hall before less than a hundred people; and the
      pain of this was more than he could bear. He went home that night with his
      friend, and labored with him with all the force of his being. "You stay
      here," he declared, "and put yourself at the mercy of your enemies! You
      waste your faculties contending with them&mdash;even knowing about them is
      enough to destroy you. And all the while you might escape from them
      altogether&mdash;might do your real work, that the world knows nothing of.
      No one can hinder you. And when you have written the book of your soul,
      then your tormentors will be&mdash;they will be like the tormentors of
      Dante! Go away! Go away to Europe, where you can be free!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so before long, he stood upon a steamer-pier and waved Henry Darrell
      and his wife farewell. And every now and then would come letters, telling
      of long, long agonies; for Darrell had to fight for those few rare days
      when ill health would permit him to think. So year by year he labored at
      what Thyrsis knew, if it was ever finished, would be America's first
      world-poem; and in the meantime eminent statesmen and moralists who were
      alarmed at the progress of "Socialist agitation", would continue to
      conjure up before the public mind the night-mare spectre of the
      once-respected clergyman, who had deserted his weeping wife and children,
      and run away with a rich woman to found a "free-love colony"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 14. A couple of days after the Darrells sailed, Thyrsis set out
      himself to find a home. On account of the new book, he would have to be
      near a library, and so he had selected a college-town not far from New
      York. He went there now, and put up for a week at a students'
      boarding-house, while prosecuting his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange experience it was to him, after the years of struggle and
      contact with the world, to come back to that academic atmosphere; to find
      men who were still peacefully counting up the "feminine endings" in
      Shakespeare's verse, and writing elaborate theses upon the sources of the
      Spenserian legends. Upon his excursions into the country some of these
      young men would tramp with him&mdash;threshing out, student-fashion, the
      problems of the universe; and how staggering it was to meet a man who was
      about to receive a master's degree in literature&mdash;and who regarded
      Arthur Hugh Clough as a "dangerous" poet, and Tennyson's "Two Voices" as
      containing vital thought, and T. H. Green as the world's leading
      philosopher! And this was the "education" that was dispensed at America's
      most aristocratic university&mdash;for this many millions of dollars had
      been contributed, and scores of magnificent buildings erected!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis saw that a partial explanation lay in the fact that in connection
      with the university there existed a great theological seminary. Some of
      these future ministers came also to the boarding-house, and Thyrsis
      listened to their shop-talk&mdash;about the difference between
      "transubstantiation" and "consubstantiation", and the status of the
      controversy over the St. John Gospel. He heard one man cite arguments from
      Paley's "Moral Philosophy"; and another making bold to state that he was
      uncertain about the verbal inspiration of the Pentateuch!
    </p>
    <p>
      To Thyrsis, as he listened to these discussions, it was as if he felt a
      black shadow stealing across his soul. He wondered why he should hate
      these men with a personal hatred; he tried to argue with himself that they
      must be well-meaning and earnest. The truth was that they seemed to him
      just like the law-students, men moved by sordid and low ideals; the only
      difference was that their minds were not so keen as the lawyers'. Thyrsis
      was coming little by little to understand the economic causes of things,
      and he perceived that this theological world represented a stagnant place
      in the stream of national culture; it being a subsidized world, maintained
      half by charity, vital men turned from it; it drew to itself the feebler
      minds, or such as wished to live at ease, and not inquire too closely into
      the difference between truth and falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 15. A few miles out from the town Thyrsis found a farm with an
      abundance of wild woodland, where the farmer gave him permission to camp.
      And so he went back and got some lumber, and loaded his tent and supplies
      on a wagon, and wrote Corydon that he would meet her the next afternoon.
      With the help of the farmer's boy he labored the rest of the day at
      building the platform, and putting up the tent, and getting their
      belongings in order. The next day he was up at dawn, constructing tables
      and stands; and later on he hired the farmer's "jagger-wagon", and drove
      in for Corydon and Cedric and the trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious spring day, of turquoise sky and glinting sunshine; and
      later, when the sun was low, the woods were flushed with a glow of scarlet
      and purple. It lent a glory to the scene, shedding a halo about the
      commonest tasks; the unpacking of blankets and dishes, the ranging of
      groceries upon shelves. They were free from all the world at last&mdash;they
      were setting out upon the journey of their lives together!
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was with singing and laughter that they went at their work. The baby
      crawled about on the tent-floor and got into everybody's way, and crowed
      with delight at the novel surroundings; and later on his mother gave him
      his supper and put him to bed; and then she spread a feast of bread and
      butter, and fresh milk and eggs and a can of fruit, and they sat down to
      the first meal they had eaten together in many a long, long month.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were tired and ravenously hungry; but their happiness of soul was
      keener even than any physical sensation, and they sat leaning upon their
      elbows and gazing across the table, reading the wonder in each other's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been a year since we parted!" whispered Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a year!" he said. "It seems like ten of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you remember, Thyrsis, how we prayed! How we prayed for this very
      hour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands in his. Once more they renewed their pledges of
      devotion; once more the vision of their hopes unrolled before them. "From
      now on," he whispered, "our life is our own! We can make it whatever we
      will. Let us make it something beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so there they made a compact. They would speak no more of the year
      that was past; it was a bad dream, and now it was gone. Let it be swept
      from their thoughts, and let them go on to make the future what they
      desired it to be.

      from the poem again&mdash; </i>

   "What though the music of thy rustic flute
        Kept not for long its happy, country tone;

        Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,

        Yet hadst thou always visions of our light!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. The <i>mise-en-scéne</i> of their new adventure in domesticity
      was a tent eighteen feet by twelve; but as the side-walls were low, they
      could walk only in the centre, and must range their belongings at the
      sides. To the left, as one entered the tent, there stood a soapbox with a
      tiny oil-stove upon it; and then a stand, made out of a packing-box, to
      hold their dishes, their cooking-utensils and their limited supply of
      provisions. Next down the line came a trunk, and in the corner the baby's
      crib&mdash;which had been outgrown by the farmer's children, and purchased
      by Thyrsis for a dollar. At the rear was a folding-table, and above it a
      board from which Corydon hung her clothing; along the other wall were her
      canvas cot, and a little stand with some books, and a wash-stand and
      another trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some distance off in the woods stood a second tent, seven feet square, in
      which Thyrsis had a cot for himself, and also a canvas-chair in which he
      sat to receive the visits of his muse. They got their drinking water from
      a spring near by; there was a tiny stream beside the tent which provided
      their washing-water. In this stream Thyrsis hollowed out a flat basin, in
      which they might set their butter-crock, and a pail of milk, and a larger
      pail that held their meat. Below that was a deeper pool from which they
      dipped water, and lower yet a third pool, with a board on which Corydon
      might sit and wash diapers, to her heart's content and her back's
      exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent had been old when Thyrsis got it, and as this was the third
      season he had used it, it was dark and dun of hue. They had not noticed
      this at the outset as they had put it up on a bright, sunshiny day, and
      also before the trees had put out all their foliage. But now, when rain
      came, they found that they had to light a lamp in order to read in the
      tent; and, of course, it was on rainy days that they had to be inside.
      Thyrsis did not realize the influence which this tent had upon his wife's
      spirits; it was only after he saw her made physically ill by having to
      live in a room with yellow wall-paper, that he came to understand the
      power which her surroundings had over Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they'so much as touched a finger to the roof of the tent while it was
      raining, a steady dripping would come through at that point. Then, as the
      rains grew heavier, water took to running down the pole that stood in the
      centre of the tent, and formed a pool in the middle of the floor, so that
      Thyrsis had to get the axe and cut a hole there. And, of course, there was
      no way to dry anything; the woods, which were low, were turned into a
      swamp, and one's shoes became caked with mud, and there was no keeping the
      tent-floor clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this place they had to keep an able-bodied, year-and-a-half-old baby!
      There was no other place to keep him. He could not be allowed on the damp
      floor, nor where he could touch the top of the tent; so Thyrsis set up
      sticks at all four corners of his crib, and tied strong twine about them,
      making a little pen; and therein they put the baby, and therein he had to
      stay. He had his rattle and his rubber-doll and his blocks and the rest of
      his gim-cracks; and after he had howled long enough to satisfy himself
      that there was no deliverance from his prison, he settled back and
      accepted his tragic fate. There came occasions when Corydon was sick, and
      unable to move; then Thyrsis would put up his umbrella and take Cedric to
      his own tent, where he would draw a chalk-line across the floor. One-half
      of the forty-nine square feet of space was his, and in it he would sit and
      read and study; in the other half the baby would play. After long
      experience he came to realize that at such times Papa would not pay any
      attention to him, and that crossing the chalk-line involved getting one's
      "mungies" spanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other troubles that fell upon them. At first, it being April,
      it was cold at night; and they had no stove, and no room for a stove.
      Later on the ceaseless rains brought a plague of mosquitoes; and so
      Thyrsis had to rig up a triangular door and cover the entrance to the tent
      with netting; and when the weather grew better, he had to get more netting
      and construct a little house, in which the baby could play outdoors. And
      then there had to be more spankings of "mungies", to teach the infant that
      this mysterious mosquito-bar must not be walked through, nor pulled at,
      nor poked with sticks, nor even eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      They prayed for fair days, and a little sunshine; and it seemed as if the
      weather-demons had discovered this, and were playing with them. There
      would come a bright morning, and they would spread a rug in the baby's
      cage, and hang out all their damp belongings to dry; and then would come a
      sudden shower, and baby and rug and belongings would all have to pile back
      into the tent. And then it would clear again, and everything would go out
      once more; and they would prepare dinner, and be comfortably settled to
      eat, when it would begin to sprinkle again. They would move in the
      clothing and the baby, and when it began to rain harder, they would move
      in the table and the food; and forthwith the rain would cease. Because it
      was poor fun eating in a dark tent by lamp-light, amid the odor of
      gas-stove and cooking, they might move out once more&mdash;but only to
      repeat the same experience over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six weeks after their arrival there was not a day without rain, and it
      would rain sometimes for half a week without ceasing. So everything they
      owned became damp and mouldy&mdash;all their clothing, their food, the
      very beds upon which they slept. One of their miseries was the lack of
      place to keep things; all their odds and ends had to be stowed away under
      the cots&mdash;where one might find clothing, and books, and manuscripts,
      and a hammock, and an umbrella, and some shoes, and a box of prunes, and a
      sack of potatoes, and half a ham. When water got in at the sides of the
      tent and wet all these objects, and the bedclothing hung over the floor
      and got into them, it was trying to the temper to have to rummage there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Before she left the city Corydon had taken the baby to consult a
      famous "child-specialist"&mdash;at five dollars per consultation; she had
      received the dreadful tidings that Cedric was threatened with the
      "rickets". So she had come out to the country with one mighty purpose in
      her soul. "Under-nourishment", the doctor had said; and he had laid out a
      regular schedule. Six times daily the unhappy infant was to be fed; and
      each time some elaborate concoction had to be got ready&mdash;practically
      nothing could be eaten in a state of nature. The first meal would consist
      of, say a poached egg on a piece of toast, and the juice of an orange,
      with the seeds carefully excluded; the next of some chicken broth with a
      cracker or two, and the pulp of prunes with the skins removed; the next of
      some beef chopped up and pounded to a pulp and broiled, together with a
      bit of mashed potato or some other cooked vegetable; the next of some
      gruel, with cream and sugar, and some more prunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these operations, of course, took the greater part of Corydon's day;
      she would struggle at them until she was ready to drop, and when she had
      to give up they would fall to Thyrsis. Some of them fell to him quite
      frequently&mdash;for instance, the pounding of the meat. It had to have
      all the fat and gristle carefully cut out; and there had to be a clean
      board, and a clean hammer, both of which must be scraped and washed
      afterwards; and whenever by any chance Corydon let the meat stay on the
      fire a second too long, so that it got hard, the whole elaborate operation
      had to be gone over again&mdash;was not the baby's life at stake?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite vain for him to protest as to the pains that Corydon took to
      remove every tiniest fragment of the skin of a stewed prune. "Surely,
      dearest," he would argue, "the internal arrangements of a baby are not so
      delicate as to be torn by a tiny bit of prune-skin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Corydon the internal arrangements of babies were mysterious things&mdash;to
      be understood only by a child-specialist at five dollars per visit. "He
      told me what to do," she would say; "and I am going to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she would prepare the concoctions, and would sit and feed them to the
      baby, spoonful by spoonful; and long after the little one had been stuffed
      to the bursting-point, she would hold the spoon poised in front of its
      mouth, making tentative passes, and seeking by some device to cajole the
      mouth into opening and admitting one last morsel of the precious
      nutriment. The child had a word of its own inventing, wherewith it denoted
      things that were good to eat. "Hee, gubum, gubum!" he would exclaim; and
      Corydon would hold the spoon and repeat "Gubum, gubum,"&mdash;long after
      the baby had begun to sputter and gasp and make plain that it was no
      longer "gubum".
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, under the instructions of the specialist, they made an attempt to
      break the child of the "hoodaloo mungie" habit. A baby should lie down and
      go to sleep without handling, the authority had declared; and now that
      there was all outdoors for him to cry in, they resolved that he should be
      taught. So they built up the fence about the crib, and laid the baby in
      for his afternoon nap, and started to go away. And the baby gave one look
      of perplexity and dismay, and then began to cry. By the time they had got
      out of the tent he was screaming like a creature possessed; and Corydon
      and Thyrsis sat outside and stared at each other in wonder and alarm. When
      she could stand it no more, they went away to a distance; but still the
      uproar went on. Now and then they would creep back and peep in at the
      purple and choking infant; and then steal away again, and discuss the
      phenomenon, and wish that the "child-specialist" were there to advise
      them. Finally, when the crying had gone on for two hours without a
      moment's pause, they gave up, because they were afraid the baby might cry
      itself into convulsions. And so the "hoodaloo mungie" habit went on for
      some time yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the "stuffing regime" the infant at first thrived amazingly; he
      became fat and rosy, and Corydon's heart beat high with joy and pride. But
      then came midsummer, and the hot season; and first of all a rash broke out
      upon the precious body, and in spite of powders and ointments, refused to
      go away. Later on came the "hives", with which the baby was spotted like
      the top of a pepper-crust. And then, as fate willed it, the family of a
      woman who did some laundry for Corydon developed the measles; and Corydon
      found it out too late&mdash;and so they were in for the first of a long
      program of "children's diseases".
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a siege that lasted for a month and more&mdash;a nightmare
      experience. The child had to be kept in a dark place, under pain of losing
      its eyesight; and when it was very hot in the tent, some one had to sit
      and fan it. It could not sleep, but writhed and moaned, now screaming in
      torment, now whimpering like a frightened cur&mdash;a sound that wrung
      Thyrsis' very heart. And oh, the sight of the little body&mdash;purple, a
      mass of eruptions, and with beads of perspiration upon it! Corydon's
      mother came to help her through this ordeal, and would sit for hours upon
      hours, rocking the wailing infant in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. But there were ups as well as downs in this tenting adventure.
      There came glorious days, when they took long tramps over the hills; or
      when Thyrsis would carry the child upon his shoulder, and they would
      wander about the meadows, picking daisies and clover, and making garlands
      for Corydon. Once Cedric sat down upon a bumble-bee, and that was hard
      upon him, and perhaps upon the bee. But for the most part the little one
      was enraptured during these excursions. He was fascinated with the
      flowers, and continually seeking for an opportunity to devour some of
      them; while he was doing it he would wear such a roguish smile&mdash;it
      was impossible not to believe that he understood the agitation which these
      abnormal appetites occasioned in his parents. Corydon would be seized with
      a sudden access of affection, and she would clutch him in her arms and
      squeeze him, and fairly smother him with kisses. Of course the youngster
      would protest wildly at this, and so not infrequently the demonstration
      would end tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't have any joy in my baby at all!" she would lament; and Thyrsis
      would have to soothe the child, and plead with her to find more practical
      ways of demonstrating her maternal devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric was beginning to make determined efforts to talk now, and he had
      the most original names for things. His parents would adopt these into
      their own speech, which thus departed rapidly from established usage. They
      had to bring themselves to realize that if they went on in that fashion,
      the child would never learn to speak so that any one else could understand
      him. The grandmothers were most strenuous upon this point, and would
      laboriously explain to the infant that chickens and pigeons and sparrows
      were not all known as "ducky-ducks"; they would plead with it to say
      "bottle of milk", while its reckless parents were delighting themselves
      with such perversions as "bobbu mookie-mook."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three times each week the farmer would bring their mail; and once a
      week they would hire an old scare-crow of a horse, and a buggy which might
      have passed for the one-horse shay in its ninety-ninth year, and drive to
      a town for provisions. It was amazing what loads of provisions a family of
      three could consume in the course of a week&mdash;especially when one of
      them was following the "stuffing regime". There had to be a lot of
      figuring done to get it for the sum of thirty dollars a month; and this
      put another grievous burden upon Thyrsis. Corydon, alas, had no talents
      for figuring, and was cursed with a weakness for such superfluities as
      clean laundry and coffee with cream. This was one more aspect of the
      difference between the Hebrew and the Greek temperament; and sometimes the
      Hebrew temperament would lose its temper, and the Greek temperament would
      take to tears. The situation was all the more complicated because of their
      pitiful ignorance. They really did not know what was necessity and what
      was luxury. For instance, Thyrsis had read somewhere that people could
      live without meat; but Corydon had never heard of such an idea, and
      insisted with vehemence that it was an absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no evading the issue of poverty; for the thirty dollars
      was all they had. "The Hearer of Truth" had been out several months now,
      and had not sold a thousand copies; and so it was to be doubted if Thyrsis
      would ever get another dollar from that. Also, he had heard from the
      translator of "The Genius", and had agreed to accept twenty-five dollars
      as an "honorarium" for the production of his play in Germany&mdash;this
      princely sum to be paid when the play came out during the following
      winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, of course, he was driving away at his new work. Domestic duties
      took up most of his morning; but he would get away into the woods in the
      afternoons, and in the evenings, when the family was asleep, he would work
      until far after midnight. He was bringing out basketfuls of books from the
      library of the university; and he lived another life in these&mdash;sharing,
      in a hundred different forms, the agony of the War. He was not writing
      yet; he was filling up his soul with the thing, making it a reservoir of
      impressions. Some times it would seem that the reservoir was nearly full,
      and he would be seized with a hunger to be at work; he would go about
      possessed by it&mdash;absent-minded, restless, nervous when he was spoken
      to. It was hard for a man who listened all night to the death-groans of
      the thousands piled up before "Bloody Angle", to get up in the morning and
      be satisfactory in the rôle of "mother's assistant".
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, again was the torment of this matrimonial bond to a man who wished
      to be an artist. He had to live two lives, when one was more than he could
      attend to; he had to be always aware of another soul yearning for him,
      reaching out to him and craving his attention. To be sure, Corydon was
      interested in what he was doing; she even made heroic efforts to read the
      books that he was reading. But she had so many duties, and so many
      headaches; and when night came she was so tired! She would ask him to tell
      her about his vision; and was not the thing untellable? Why else did he
      have to labor day and night, like a man possessed? He would explain this
      to her, and she would bid him go on and do his work and not mind her. But
      when he would take her at her word, and there would follow a week or two
      of indifference and preoccupation&mdash;then he would discover that she
      was again unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. This never ceased to be the case between them; but perhaps it was
      intensified at this time by the fact that their sex-life had to be
      suppressed. This was a problem which they had talked out between them
      before they came away. Thyrsis, who was groping for the truth about these
      matters, had come to the conclusion that the factor which gave dignity and
      meaning to intercourse between a man and woman was the desire, or at any
      rate the willingness, to create a child. Corydon was not sure that she
      agreed with him in this; but so far as their own case was concerned, it
      was quite clear that they could take no remotest chance of any accident&mdash;another
      child would mean certain destruction for all three of them. And so they
      had gone back to the "brother and sister" arrangement with which they had
      begun life. This was a simple matter for Thyrsis, who was utterly wrapped
      up in his book; it was not so simple for Corydon, though neither of them
      realized it, nor could have been brought to admit it. As usual, Corydon
      desired to be what he was, and to feel what he felt; and so Thyrsis did
      not realize how another side of her was being blighted. Hers was
      predominantly a love-nature; it was intolerable to her that any one she
      loved should not love her in return, and love her in the same way, and to
      the same extent; and now, when her entire being went out to him, she found
      herself obliged to suppress her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the thing would break out in spite of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she would cry, "aren't you going to kiss me good-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I kiss you, dearest?" he would answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but such a cold and perfunctory kiss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he would come and put his arms about her; but even while she held
      him thus, she would feel the life go out of his caresses, and see his eyes
      with a far-off expression. She would know that his thoughts were away upon
      some battle-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Thyrsis," she would exclaim. "Do you really love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear," he would reply. "I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how <i>much</i> do you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he would be dumb. What a question to ask him! As if he had the
      time and the energy to climb to those heights, to speak again that
      difficult language! Had he not told her a thousand times how much he loved
      her! and could she not believe it and understand it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should it be so hard to tell me?" she would protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would answer that to him it was a denial of love to explain or to
      make promises. He was as unchangeable as the laws of nature&mdash;he could
      no more be faithless to her soul than he could to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to take that for granted," he would say; "to know it as you
      know that the sun will rise to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Thyrsis," she would answer, when he used this metaphor, "don't
      people sometimes like to go out and see the sun rise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. The summer passed; and Thyrsis found to his dismay that his
      relentless muse had not yet permitted him to write a word. He had not a
      sufficient grasp upon his mighty subject&mdash;nor for that matter had he
      freedom to get by himself and wrestle it out. He shrunk from that
      death-grapple, while they were in this unsettled state. They could not
      stay in tents through the winter-time; and where were they to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was consumed with the desire to build a tiny house in these woods.
      He had roamed the country over, without finding any place that was
      habitable; and besides, he did not want to pay rent&mdash;he wanted a home
      of his own, however humble. He had meant to build one with the money from
      "The Hearer of Truth"; but now there came a statement from the publisher,
      showing that there would be due him on the book a trifle over eleven
      dollars!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried a new plan. He wrote out a "scenario" of his projected novel, and
      sent this to his publisher, to see if he could get a contract in advance.
      He asked for five hundred dollars&mdash;with that he could build the house
      he wanted, and live for another six months, until the book was done. The
      publisher wrote him to come to the city, where, after some parleying, he
      submitted a proposition; he would advance the money and publish the book,
      paying ten per cent. royalty; but he must also have the option to publish
      the author's future writings for ten years upon the same basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rather staggered Thyrsis. He was business-man enough by this time to
      realize that if he ever had a real success he could get fifteen or twenty
      per cent. upon his future work&mdash;there were even some authors who got
      twenty-five per cent. And moreover, he did not like to tie himself to this
      publisher, who was of the hard and grasping type. He went home to think it
      over, and in the end he wrote to Henry Darrell. He set forth the
      situation, and showed how much money it might mean to him&mdash;money
      which he would otherwise be able to devote to some useful purpose. It all
      depended upon what Darrell could do in the emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited three weeks, and then came Darrell's reply, saying that he could
      not possibly do what Thyrsis wished. There were so many calls upon him&mdash;the
      Socialist paper was in trouble, and so on. Thereupon Thyrsis wrote to the
      publisher to say that he accepted the offer and would sign the contract;
      but in a couple of days he received a curt reply, to the effect that the
      publisher had changed his mind, and no longer cared to consider the
      arrangement. He had, as Thyrsis found afterwards, got rid of the
      enthusiastic young man who had inveigled him into "The Hearer of Truth";
      and perhaps also he had been reading the ridicule which the critics were
      pouring out upon that unhappy book.
    </p>
    <p>
      So once more Thyrsis wrote to Darrell&mdash;a letter of agonized entreaty.
      He was at the most critical moment of his life; and now, at the very
      culmination of his effort, to have to give up would be a calamity he could
      simply not contemplate. If only he could finish the task, he would be
      saved; for this was a book that would grip men and shake them&mdash;that
      it should fail was simply unthinkable. He could make out with two hundred
      dollars; and he besought his friend at any sacrifice to stand by him. He
      asked him to cable; and when, a couple of weeks later, the message came&mdash;"all
      right"&mdash;to Thyrsis it was like waking up and escaping from the grip
      of some terrible dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. And so began the house-building. It was high time, too&mdash;the
      latter part of September, and the nights were growing chill. He sought out
      a carpenter to help him, and had an interview with his friend the farmer,
      who agreed to rent a bit of land, in a corner of his orchard, by the edge
      of the wood. It was under the shade of a great elm-tree, and sufficiently
      remote from all the world to satisfy the taste of any literary hermit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For months before this he and Corydon had discussed the plans of their
      future home; every square inch of it had been a subject of debate. In its
      architectural style it was a compromise between Corydon's aesthetic
      yearnings, and the rigid standards of economy which circumstance imposed.
      It was to be eighteen feet long and sixteen feet wide&mdash;six feet high
      at the sides and nine in the centre. It was to be "weather-boarded", and
      roofed with paper, instead of shingles&mdash;this being so much cheaper.
      Corydon heard with dismay that it would be necessary to paint this
      roofing-paper black; and Thyrsis, by way of compensation, agreed that the
      weather-boards should have some "natural finish", instead of common paint.
      There was to be a six-foot piazza in front, and a little platform in back,
      with steps descending to the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been long discussions about the method of heating the mansion.
      Corydon had been observing the customs of her neighbors in this typical
      "small-farming" district, and declared that they had two leading
      characteristics: first, they were not happy until they had had all their
      own teeth extracted, and a complete set of "store-teeth" substituted; and
      second, as soon as they moved into a house, they boarded over the open
      fire-place and covered the boards with wall-paper. But Thyrsis, making
      investigations along practical lines, found that the open fire-place had a
      bad reputation as a consumer of fuel; and also, it would take a mason to
      build a chimney, and the wages of masons were high. So Corydon had to
      reconcile herself to a house with a stove, and a stove-pipe that went
      through a hole in the wall!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless this house-building time was one of the happiest periods of
      their lives. For here was something constructive, in which they could both
      be occupied. Thyrsis would be up and at work early in the morning, before
      the carpenter came; and in between the baby's various meals, Corydon would
      come also, and take part in the operations. A miraculous thing it was to
      see the house of their dreams coming into being, with every feature just
      as they had planned it. And what a palatial structure it was&mdash;with so
      much space and air! One could actually move about in it without danger of
      striking one's head; coming into it from the tent, one felt as if he were
      entering a cathedral!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so consumed with a desire to see it finished, that Thyrsis would
      stay at the work until darkness came upon him, and sometimes even worked
      by moon-light, or with a lantern. And how proud they would be when the
      carpenter came next morning, and found the last roof-boards laid, or the
      flooring all completed! Thyrsis learned the mysteries of window-sills and
      door-frames, the excitements of "weather-boarding," and the perils of
      roof-painting. He realized with wonder how many achievements of
      civilization the privileged classes take as a matter of course. What a
      remarkable thing it was, when one came to think of it, that a door should
      swing true upon its hinges, and fit exactly into its frame, and latch with
      a precise and soul-satisfying snap! And that windows should slide up and
      down in their frames, and stop at certain places with a spring-catch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon too was interested in these discoveries, and became skilled at
      holding weather-boards while her husband nailed them, and at helping to
      unroll and measure roofing-paper, and climbing up the ladder and holding
      it in place. Even the baby became fired with the spirit of achievement,
      and would get himself a hammer and a board, and plague his parents until
      they started a dozen or so of nails for him&mdash;after which he would sit
      and blissfully pound them into the board, and all but pound them through
      the board in his enthusiasm. Before long he even learned to start them
      himself; and a most diverting sight it was to see this twenty-two-months
      old youngster driving nails like an infant Hercules. For the fastening of
      the roofing-paper they used little circular plates of tin called
      "cotterels"; and these also Cedric must learn to use. So a new phrase was
      added to the vocabulary of "dam-fool talk". "Bongie cowtoos" was the name
      of the operation; for a couple Of years thereafter, whenever Corydon and
      Thyrsis wished to be let alone to discuss the problems of the universe,
      they would get the baby a hammer and some nails and a board, and repeat
      that magic formula, and the problem was solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, however, it was not all smooth sailing in the
      carpentry-business. There were mashed thumbs and sawed fingers; and then,
      in an evil hour, Thyrsis came upon an advertisement which told of a
      wonderful new kind of wall-paper which could be applied directly to laths&mdash;thus
      enabling one to dispense with plaster. He sent for ten or twelve dollars'
      worth of this material, and he and Corydon spent a whole morning making a
      mixture of glue and flour-paste and water, and boiling it in an iron
      preserving-kettle. But alas, the paper would not paste; and then they had
      a painful time. Corydon gave up in disgust, and went away; but Thyrsis, to
      whom economy was a kind of disease, would not give up, and was angry with
      the other for urging him to give up. He spent a whole day wrestling with
      the concoction, and gave himself a headache with the ghastly odor. But in
      the end he had to dump it out, and clean the kettle, and fasten the paper
      to the lathes with "bongie cowtoos". As the strips of paper did not
      correspond with the studding, he found himself driving nails into springy
      laths, an operation most trying to the temper of any man of letters. One
      of the trials of this house forever after was that upon the least jar a
      corner of the ceiling was liable to fall loose; and then one would have to
      get a ladder, and climb up into a hot region, and pound nails into a
      broken lath, with dust sifting down into one's eyes, and the hammer
      hitting one's sore thumb, and occasioning exclamations not at all suitable
      for the ears of a two-year-old intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. When the doors were fitted, and the windows set in, and the
      piazza laid, and the steps built, they got down to the furniture, which
      was also to be home-made. Thyrsis was gratified beyond telling by these
      tables and dressing-stands and shelves and book-cases, which he could
      build of hemlock boards in an hour or two, and which cost only thirty or
      forty cents apiece. He would labor with Corydon to induce her to share
      this joy; but alas, he would only succeed in losing his own joy, without
      increasing hers. On many occasions he attempted such things as this; it
      was only after long years that he came to realize that Corydon's
      temperament was the one fixed fact in the universe with which he had to
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred and twenty-five dollars was the total cost of this
      establishment when completed. And while the carpenter was putting the
      finishing touches, Thyrsis was using up thirty dollars more of lumber in
      constructing himself a "study" in the woods near by. Eight by ten this
      cabin was to be; it was to have a door and a window, and a little piazza
      in front, upon which the inhabitant might sit in fair weather. Also
      Thyrsis built for it a table and a bookcase; and as he had now eighty
      square feet instead of forty-nine, there was room for a cot and a chair,
      and a coal-stove fourteen inches in diameter. As fate would have it, there
      was some black paint left over; and to Corydon's horror it was announced
      that this would be used on the study. However, Thyrsis insisted that it
      was <i>his</i> study; and besides, there was some red paint left, with
      which he might decorate the window and the door-frame, and stripe the
      edges of the roof and the corners. Surely that would be festivity enough
      for the most exacting of Greek temperaments!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the rapturous experience of moving into these new mansions. The
      joy of having shelves to put things on, and hooks to hang things from. Of
      being able to take books and manuscripts out of their trunks, and not pile
      them under their beds. Of carrying over their belongings, and having
      everything fit into the place that had been made for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis purchased an old stove, and also a kitchen-range from a neighbor;
      he sank a barrel in the spring, and walled it round with cement; he built
      a stand in the kitchen, and set up a sink and a little pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the time of year when there were held at various places in the
      country what the neighbors called "vandews". He and Corydon found it
      diverting to get the scarecrow nag and the one-horse shay, and drive to
      some farm-house, where one might see the history of a family for the last
      fifty years spread out upon the lawn. They would stand round in the cold
      and snow while the auctioneer disposed of the horses and cows and hay and
      machinery, waiting until he came to the household objects upon which they
      had set their eye. So they would invest in some stove-pipe, and a couple
      of ghastly chromos (for the sake of the frames), and some odds and ends of
      crockery, and a spade, and some old rope to make a swing for the baby.
      They would get these things for five or ten cents each, and get in
      addition all the excitements of the bargain-hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once they had a real adventure&mdash;they came upon a wonderful old
      "grandfather's clock", about six feet high; and Corydon exclaimed in
      rapture, "Oh Thyrsis I'd be happy for the rest of my life if we could have
      that clock!" On such terms it appeared to Thyrsis that the clock might be
      worth making a sacrifice for, and he got up the courage to declare that he
      would offer as high as five dollars for it. And so they stood, trembling
      with excitement, and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't lose it, even if it's as high as six dollars!" whispered Corydon;
      but alas, the first bid for the clock was twenty-five dollars. They stood
      staring with dismay, until the treasure was sold to a dealer from the city
      for the incredible sum of eighty-seven dollars; and then they drove home,
      quite awe-stricken by this sudden intrusion from the world of luxury
      outside their ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. However, this disappointment did not trouble them for long; there
      were too many luxuries in their own home. Not very long after it was
      finished, there fell a deluge of rain; and what a delight it was to listen
      to it, and know that they were safe from it! That not only did they have a
      dry roof over their head&mdash;but they were able to move about, and to
      reach up their hands without peril, and to sit down and read without a
      lamp! They would stand by the window with their arms about each other,
      watching the rain beating upon the fields, and dripping from the elm tree,
      and flowing in torrents past the house; they would listen to it pounding
      overhead and streaming off the roof before their faces. They were dry,
      quite dry! All their belongings were dry&mdash;their shoes were not
      mildewing, their books were not getting soft and shapeless, their
      bed-clothing would be all right when night came!
    </p>
    <p>
      The down-pour lasted for three whole days, yet they enjoyed it all. It
      proved to be a memorable rain to Corydon, for it brought to her a great
      occasion&mdash;the beginning of her poetical career. It happened late one
      night, when, as usual, the cry of "hoodaloo mungie" awakened her from a
      sound slumber. The day had been a particularly hard one, and the heaviness
      of exhaustion was upon her. For a moment she stared up into the darkness,
      listening to the rain close above her, and trying to nerve herself to put
      out her arm in the cold. She shuddered at the thought; there came to her a
      perfectly definite impulse of hatred&mdash;hatred of the child, of its
      noise and its demands. She had felt it before&mdash;sometimes as a dull,
      cold dislike, sometimes as something passionate. Why should she have to
      sacrifice herself to this insatiable creature, whom she did not love? What
      did it matter to her if other women loved their children? She had wanted
      life&mdash;and was this life? At that moment the cry of "hoodaloo-mungie"
      symbolized for her all the sordid cares and nervous agony of her
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, unexpectedly, a daring impulse seized her. "No!" she
      thought, and set her teeth&mdash;"I'll let him cry! I'll cure him of this&mdash;and
      I'll do it to-night!" So she turned and told Cedric to go to sleep; at
      which, of course, the child began to scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon lay very still in the dark, her eyes wide and every nerve tense.
      She could not feel, she could not think; it seemed as though she were
      deprived of every sense except that of hearing; and in her, through her,
      and around her rang a senseless din, piercing, intense, increasing in
      volume every minute, and completely drowning out the beating of the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I stand it?" she thought. "Or will his lungs burst? And yet, I must,
      I must&mdash;this can't go on forever!" And so she clenched her hands and
      waited. But the sounds did not diminish in the slightest; ten minutes
      twenty minutes must have passed, and the baby only seemed to gain
      increased power with each crescendo.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Corydon at last as though she had always lain like this, and
      as though she must for endless time. She found herself getting used to it
      even; her muscles relaxed. There came to her a sense of the ludicrous side
      of it. "He means to conquer me!" she thought. "Can I hold out? If I only
      had something to think about, then I'd be a match for him." And suddenly
      the inspiration came to her. "I'll write a poem!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What should it be about? The rain had been increasing in violence, and she
      became conscious of the steady downpour; it fascinated her, and she
      concentrated her attention upon it, and began&mdash;-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "I am the rain, that comes in spring!"
</pre>
    <p>
      So, after a while, she found herself in the throes of composition; she was
      eager, excited&mdash;and marvel of marvels, utterly forgetful of the baby!
      She had never tried to write verses before; but it did not seem at all
      difficult to her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem was simple and optimistic&mdash;it told of the beneficent
      qualities of rain, as it would appear to one whose roof did not leak.
      Somewhere in the course of it there was this stanza:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "I am the rain that comes at night,
    When all in slumber is folded light&mdash;
    Save one by weary vigils worn
    Who counteth the drops unto the morn."
</pre>
    <p>
      This seemed to her an impressive bit, and she wondered what Thyrsis would
      think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were eight stanzas altogether, and when she finished the last of
      them the dawn was breaking, and it seemed hours since she had begun. As
      for the baby, he was still crying. She turned and peered at him; his
      eyelids drooped, and the crying came in spasms and gasps&mdash;it sounded
      very feeble, and a trifle perfunctory. Obviously he could not hold out
      much longer; Corydon would win, yes, she had won already. She lay still,
      and thrills of happiness went through her. Was it the poem, or the thought
      of her release, and the nights of quiet sleep in the future?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thyrsis came in, an hour or two later, he found her huddled up in
      blankets on the floor of the living-room, her cheeks bright, her hair
      dishevelled. How fascinating she looked in such a guise! She was eagerly
      pondering her poem; and the baby was sleeping quietly, save for a few
      convulsive gasps, the last stragglers of his routed forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And oh, Thyrsis," she exclaimed, "to-morrow night he will only cry half
      as long, and still less the next night. And soon he will go to sleep
      quietly like any well brought-up, civilized baby. And, my dear, I believe
      I'm going to be a poetess&mdash;I think that to-night I was really
      inspired!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So he made haste to build a fire, and then came and sat and listened to
      the poem. How eagerly she waited for his verdict! How she hung upon his
      words! And what should a man do in such a case&mdash;should he be a
      husband or a critic? Should he be an amateur or a professional?
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he hesitated, the damage was done. "Oh, you don't like it!"
      she cried. "You don't think it's good at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he argued, "poetry is such a difficult thing to write. And
      there are so many standards&mdash;a thing can be good, and yet not good!
      The heights are so far away&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But oh, how can I ever get there," wailed Corydon, "if nobody gives me
      any encouragement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. The time had now come for Thyrsis to put his job through. There
      was no longer any excuse for hesitation or delay. The book had come to
      ripeness in him; the birth-hour was at hand, and he must go and have it
      out with himself. He explained these things to Corydon, sitting beside her
      and holding her hands; they ascended once more to the heights of
      consecration; they renewed their vows of fortitude and faith, and then he
      went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks thereafter he would be like the ghost of a man in the house,
      haggard and silent and preoccupied. All the work that he had ever done in
      his life seemed but child's play in comparison. Before this he had
      portrayed the struggles of men and women; but now he was to portray the
      agony of a whole nation&mdash;his heart must beat with the pulse of
      millions of suffering people. And the task was like a fiend that came upon
      him in the night-time and laid hold of him, dragging him away to sights of
      terror and madness. He was never safe from the thing for a moment&mdash;he
      could never tell when it might assail him. He might be washing the dishes,
      or wrestling with the refractory pump; but the vision would come to him,
      and he would wander off into the forest&mdash;perhaps to sit, crouching in
      the snow, trembling, and staring at the pageant in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived in the midst of battles; the smoke of powder always in his
      nostrils, the crash of musketry and the thunder of cannon in his ears. He
      saw the cavalry sweeping over the plains, the infantry crouching behind
      intrenchments; he heard the yells of the combatants, the shrieks of the
      wounded and dying; he saw the mangled bodies, and the ground slippery with
      blood. New aspects of the thing kept coming to him&mdash;new glimpses into
      meanings yet untold. They would come to him in great bursts of emotion,
      like tempests that swept him away; and these things he had to wrestle with
      and master. It meant toil, the like of which he had never faced before, a
      tension of all his faculties, that would last for hours and hours, and
      leave him bathed in perspiration, and utterly exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene would come to him, in some moment of insight; and he would drop
      everything else, and follow it. He would go over it, at the same time both
      creating and beholding it, at the same time both overwhelmed by it and
      controlling it&mdash;but above all things else, remembering it! He would
      be like Aladdin in the palace, stuffing his pockets with priceless jewels;
      coming away so loaded down that he could hardly stagger, and spilling them
      on every side. Then, scarcely pausing to rest, he would go back after what
      he had lost; he would grope about, gathering diamonds and rubies that he
      had all but forgotten&mdash;or perhaps coming upon new vaults and new
      treasure-chests.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he would labor over a description, going over it and over it, not so
      much working it out, as letting it work itself out and stamp itself upon
      his memory. It made no difference how long the scene might be, he would
      not write a word of it; it might be some battle-picture, that would fill
      thirty or forty pages&mdash;he would know it all by heart, as Demosthenes
      or Webster might have known an oration. And only at the end would he write
      it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over some of the scenes in this new book he labored thus for two or three
      weeks at a stretch; there would be literally not a moment of the day, nor
      perhaps of the night, when the thing was not working in some part of his
      mind. He would think about it for hours before he fell asleep; and when he
      opened his eyes it would be waiting at his bedside to pounce upon him. If
      he tried for even a few minutes to rest, or to divert his mind to some
      other work, he would find himself ill at ease and troubled, with a sense
      as of something pulling at him, calling to him. And if anything came to
      interrupt him, then he would be like a baker whose oven grows cold before
      the bread is half done&mdash;it would be a sad labor making anything out
      of that batch of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. And this work he had to do as a married man, the father of a
      family and the head of a household; living with a child who was one
      incessant and irrepressible demand for attention, and a wife who was
      wrestling with weakness and sickness&mdash;eating out her heart in cruel
      loneliness, and cowering in the grip of fiends of melancholia and despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thought that when they moved into the new home, their domestic
      trials would be at an end. But now the cruel winter fell upon them. They
      had never known what a winter in the country was like; they came to see
      why the farmer had protested against their building in such a remote
      place. There were many days when they could not get to town, and some when
      they could not even get to the farm-house. Also there was the pump, which
      was continually freezing, and necessitating long and troublesome
      operations before they could get any water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as fate would have it, the worst winter in the oldest inhabitant's
      memory. The farmer's well froze over on three occasions, and it had never
      frozen before, so he declared. For such weather as this they were
      altogether unprepared; they had only a wood-stove, and could not keep a
      fire all night; and the cheap blankets they had bought were made all of
      cotton, and gave them almost no protection. They would not sleep with the
      windows down; and so, for weeks at a time, they would go to bed with their
      clothing, even their overcoats on; and would pile curtains and rugs upon
      these&mdash;and even so, they would waken at two or three o'clock in the
      morning, shivering and chilled to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this icy room they would have to get up and build a fire; and it
      might be half an hour before they could get the house warm. Also, they had
      no facilities for bathing; and so little by little they began to lose
      their habits of decency&mdash;there were days when Corydon left her face
      unwashed, and forgot to brush her hair. Everyday, it seemed, they slipped
      yet further down the grade. Thyrsis would work until he was faint and
      exhausted, and then he would come over, and find there was nothing ready
      to eat. By the time that he and Corydon had cooked a meal, they would both
      of them be ravenous, and they would sit and devour their food like a
      couple of savages. Then, because they had over-eaten, they would have to
      rest before they cleared things away; and like as not Thyrsis would get to
      thinking about his work, and go off and leave everything&mdash;and the
      dishes and the food might stay up on the table until the next meal. There
      was nearly always a piled-up mass of dishes and skillets and sauce-pans in
      the house&mdash;to Thyrsis these soiled dishes were the original source of
      the myth of Sisyphus and his labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was the garbage-pail that he had forgotten to empty, and
      the lamps he had neglected to fill, and the slop-pails and the other
      utensils of domesticity. There were the diapers that somebody had to wash&mdash;and
      outside was always the bitter, merciless cold, that drove them in and shut
      them up with all this horror. The time came, as the winter dragged on,
      when the house which they had built with so many sacrifices, and into
      which they had moved with such eager anticipations, came to seem to them
      like a cave in which a couple of wild beasts cowered for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. There was another great change which this cold weather effected
      in their lives; it broke down the barriers they had been at such pains to
      build up between them. It was all very well for them to agree that they
      were "brother and sister," and that it was impossible for them ever to
      think of anything else. But now came a time when night after night the
      thermometer went to ten or fifteen degrees below zero; and first Thyrsis
      gave more bedding to Corydon&mdash;because she was able to suffer more
      than he; and he would go over to his cold hut alone, and crawl into a cold
      bed, and lie there the whole night through without a wink of sleep. But
      then, as the cold held on for a week or more, the resistance of both of
      them was broken down&mdash;they were like two animals which crawl into the
      same hole to keep each other from freezing. They piled all their bedding
      upon one narrow cot; and sleeping thus, they could be warm. Even then,
      they tried to keep to the resolution they had made; but this, it seemed,
      was not within the power of flesh and blood; and so, once more, the
      sex-factor was introduced into the complications of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Thyrsis this thing was like some bird of prey that circled in the sky
      just above him&mdash;its shadow filling him with a continual fear, the
      swish of its wings making him cringe. He was never happy about it; there
      was no time in his life when he was not in a state of inward war. His
      intellect rebelled; and on the other hand, there was a part of his nature
      that craved this sex-experience and welcomed it&mdash;and this part, it
      seemed, was favored by all the circumstances of life. There was no chance
      to settle the matter in the light of reason, to test it by any moral or
      aesthetic law; blind fate decreed that one part of him should have the
      shaping of his character, the determining of his needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to make clear to himself the basis of his distrust. Sexual
      intercourse as a habit&mdash;this was the formula by which he summed it up
      to himself. To be right, to win the sanction of the intellect and the
      conscience, the sex-act must be the result of a supreme creative impulse.
      Its purpose was the making of a new soul&mdash;and this could never be
      right until those who took that responsibility had used their reasons, and
      determined that circumstances were such that the new soul might be a sound
      and free and happy and beautiful soul. And how different was this from the
      customs which prevailed under the sanction of the "holy bonds of
      matrimony"! When sexual intercourse became a self-indulgence, like the
      eating of candy, or the drinking of liquor; a thing of the body, and the
      body alone; a thing determined by physical propinquity, by the sight and
      contact of the flesh, the dressing and undressing in the same room!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again, the means which they had to use to prevent conception&mdash;which
      destroyed all spontaneity in their relationship, and dragged the thing out
      into the cold light of day! And the continual fear that they might have
      made another blunder! Something of this sort was always happening, or
      seeming to have happened, or threatening to have happened, so that they
      waited each month in suspense and dread. It was this which made the terror
      of the whole matter to Thyrsis, and had so much to do with his repugnance.
      They were like people drawing lots for a death-sentence; like people who
      ate from dishes, one of which they knew to contain poison. What was the
      tragic destiny that hung over them&mdash;the Nemesis that gripped them,
      and forced them to take such a chance?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the barriers were down, and there was no building them up again;
      Thyrsis never even tried, because of the revelation which came to him from
      Corydon's side. Corydon was craving, reaching out hungrily for something
      which she had not in herself, and which life did not give her in
      sufficiency. She called this thing "love"; and she had no hesitations and
      no limits to her demand for it. To Thyrsis this "love" was something quite
      else&mdash;it was sustenance and support. To demand it was an act of
      weakness, and to yield it was a kind of spiritual blood-transfusion. It
      was the first law of his life-code that every soul must stand upon its own
      feet and walk its own way; and to surrender that spiritual autonomy was
      the one blunder for which there could be no pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;he would argue with himself&mdash;what folly it was to talk
      of such things in their position! They not souls at all&mdash;the life of
      the soul was not for them, the laws of the soul had nothing to do with
      them. They were two bodies&mdash;two miserable and cold and sick and
      tormented bodies; and with yet a third body, utterly helpless and
      dependent upon them&mdash;in defiance of all the most high-sounding
      pronouncements about "the soul"!
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis would mock himself into subjection once more, and go on to play
      his part as husband and father and head of a household of bodies. He would
      play the game of "love" as Corydon wanted it played; he would yield to her
      demands, he would gratify her cravings, he would force himself to take her
      point of view. But then the other mood would come upon him&mdash;the mood
      that he knew to be the real expression of himself. He would begin the
      battle of his genius again; he would "hear the echoes afar off, the
      thunder of the captains and the shouting". If one gave one's self up to
      the body, and accepted the regimen and the laws of the body, how should
      the soul ever come to be free? To make such a concession was to pass upon
      it a sentence of life-imprisonment!
    </p>
    <p>
      So would come to Thyrsis again that sense of the awful tragedy that was
      impending in their lives. Some day, he knew, he would break out of this
      prison. Some day, he knew, he would have to be himself, and live his own
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile, how pitiful were Corydon's attempts to shape him to her
      needs, and to persuade herself that she was succeeding in doing it! She
      would set forth to him elaborately how much he had improved; how much
      gentler and more human he was&mdash;in contrast with that blind and stupid
      and egotistical and impossible person she had first known. And with what
      bitterness Thyrsis would hear this&mdash;and how he had to struggle to
      suppress his feeling! For he knew that those qualities which were so
      hateful to her, were but the foam cast up to the surface of his soul by
      the seething of his genius within. When it had ceased altogether, how
      placid and still would be the pool-and what a beautiful mirror it would
      make for Corydon to behold her own features in!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. In later years they used to discuss this problem, and they could
      never be sure what would have happened in their lives&mdash;what would
      have been the reaction of their different temperaments&mdash;if they had
      been given any fair chance to live and grow as they wanted to. But here
      they were, mashed together in this stew-pot of domesticity, with all the
      most unlovely aspects of things forced continually upon their attention.
      Each was in some way a handicap and a torment to the other&mdash;a means
      which fate used to limit and crush and destroy the other; and as ever,
      they had in their hours of anguish no recourse save to sit down and reason
      it out together, and absolve each other from blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis invented a phrase whereby he might make this point clear to
      Corydon, and keep it in her thoughts. The phrase was "the economic screw";
      it pressed upon him, and through him it crushed her. All things that he
      sought to be and could not be, all things that he would not be and was;
      all that was hard and unloving in him&mdash;his irritability and
      impatience, his narrowness and bitterness&mdash;in all this he showed her
      that cruel force that was destroying them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard rôle for Thyrsis, to be the judge and the jury and the
      executioner of the stern will of this "economic screw". There was, for
      instance, the episode of the "turkey-red table-cover", which became a
      classic in their later lives. Corydon was always chafing at the bareness
      of their little home; and going into the shops in the town, and
      discovering things which might have made it lovely. One evil day she went
      alone; and when she came back, Thyrsis, as usual, pounced upon his mail,
      and came upon a letter from a magazine-editor whom he had been trying to
      please with an article, and who now scolded him mercilessly for his
      obstinacy and his egotism and his didacticism, and all his other
      unpublishable qualities. Then came the unwrapping of the bundles, and
      Corydon's guileless and joyful announcement that she had come upon a
      wonderful bargain in the dry-goods store, a beautiful piece of
      "turkey-red" cloth which would serve as the table-cover for which her soul
      had been pining&mdash;and which she had obtained for the incredibly small
      sum of thirty cents!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, of course, Thyrsis began to exclaim in dismay. Thirty cents was
      a third of all they had to live upon for a day! And to pay it for a fool
      piece of rag for which they had no earthly need! So Corydon sank down in
      the middle of the floor and dissolved in floods of tears; and at the next
      trip into town the "turkey-red table-cover" was returned, and over the
      bare board table there were new expositions of the theory of the "economic
      screw"!
    </p>
    <p>
      To these arguments Corydon would listen and assent. With her intellect she
      was at one with him, and she strove to make this intellect supreme. But
      always, deep underneath, was the other side of her being, that had nothing
      to do with intellect, but was pure primitive impulse&mdash;and that pushed
      and drove in her always, and carried her away the moment that intellect
      loosened its brake. Corydon was ashamed of this primitive self&mdash;she
      was always repudiating it, always shutting her eyes to it. There was no
      way to wound her so deeply as to posit its reality and identify it with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always fighting to make her temperament like Thyrsis'; she
      despised her own temperament utterly, and set up his qualities as her
      ideal. He was self-contained and masterful; he knew what he wanted and how
      to get it; he was not dependent upon anyone else, he needed no one's
      approval or admiration; he could control his emotions, and destroy those
      that inconvenienced him. So Corydon must be these things also; she <i>was</i>
      these things, and no one must gainsay it! And if ever she had felt or
      wished or said or done anything else&mdash;that was all misunderstanding
      or delusion or accident; she would repudiate it with grief and
      indignation, and proclaim herself the creature of pure reason that every
      person ought to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      But then would come something that appealed to her emotions&mdash;to her
      love of beauty, her craving for joy; and there in a flash was the
      primitive self again. The task of compelling Corydon to economy reminded
      her husband of a toy which had been popular in his childhood days. The
      name of it was "Pigs in Clover"; there were five little balls which you
      had to coax into a narrow entrance, and while you were getting the last
      one in, the other four were almost certain to roll out. It was a labor of
      hours to get Corydon to recognize an unpleasant fact; and then&mdash;the
      next day she had forgotten it. There were some things about himself and
      his life that he could never get her to understand; for instance, his
      preoccupation with the newspaper&mdash;that symbol of all that was hateful
      in life. Just then was the beginning of the Russian revolution; and to
      Thyrsis the Russian revolution was like the coming of relief to a
      shipwrecked mariner. It was a personal thing to him&mdash;the overthrow of
      a horror that pressed upon the life of every human being upon earth. And
      so each day he hungered for the news, and when the paper came he would
      pounce upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now dearest," he would say, "please don't disturb me. I want to read."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," she would answer; and five minutes would pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;"Do you want potatoes for supper, Thyrsis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear. But I'm reading now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right." And then another five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis, who was Boadicea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm reading now, dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes." And then another five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis, do you spell choke with an a?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At which Thyrsis would put down the paper. "Tell me, Corydon&mdash;isn't
      there something I can do so that you won't interrupt me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a look of pain would sweep across her face. "Do you have to
      speak to me like that, Thyrsis? If you'd only just tell me, kindly and
      pleasantly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I've told you three or four times!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis! How can you say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But didn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they would have an argument. He would bring up each case and
      confront her with it; and how very unloving a procedure was that&mdash;and
      how exasperating was his manner as he did it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13. Then again, Corydon would be going into town to do some
      shopping; and he would ask her to bring out the afternoon paper. It would
      be the day of the October massacre, for instance; and he be on fire for
      the next batch of news. He would explain this to her; he would tell her
      again and again&mdash;whatever else she forgot, she must remember the
      afternoon paper. He would walk out to meet her, burning with impatience;
      and he would ask for the paper, and see a blank look come over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, he would scold. He had certain phrases&mdash;"How
      perfectly unspeakable! Perfectly paralyzing!" How she hated these phrases!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had so many things to get!" she would exclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But only one thing for me, Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is for you&mdash;just as much as for myself! All these
      groceries&mdash;look at the bundles! I haven't had a single moment&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how many moments does it take to buy a newspaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how many times would I have to tell you? Have I got to go into town
      myself, just for the sake of a newspaper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I tried my very best to remember it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's the matter with you? Is your mind getting weak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then like as not Corydon would burst into tears. "Oh, I think you are
      a brute!" she would cry. "A perfect brute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Or else, perhaps, she would grow angry, and they would rail at each other,
      exchanging recriminations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have burdens enough in my life," he would exclaim. "I've a
      right to some help from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no sense of proportion!" she would answer. "You are impossible!
      You would drive any saint to distraction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so. But I can't drive you anywhere, and I'm sick of trying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if you only weren't such a talker! You talk&mdash;talk&mdash;talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while they did this, what grief was in the depths of them! And
      afterwards, what ghastly wounds in Corydon's soul, that had to be bound up
      and tended and healed! The pity of it; the shame of it&mdash;that they
      should be able to descend to such sordidness! That their love, which they
      had planned as a noble temple, should turn out an ugly hovel!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Thyrsis!" the girl would cry. "The idea that you should think less of
      my soul than of an old newspaper!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is not so, dearest," he would answer. He would try to explain to
      her how much the newspaper had meant to him, and just why his annoyance
      had got the better of him. So they would rehearse the scene over again;
      and like as not their irritation would sweep over them, and before they
      realized it they would find themselves disputing once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis would be making a desperate attempt to bring her to a realization
      of his difficulties; he would be in the midst of pouring out some
      eloquence, when she would interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis, wait a moment&mdash;you do not understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am speaking!" he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Thyrsis&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am speaking!" He would not be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then would come a time when they sat down together and talked all this
      out, perceiving it as one more aspect of the disharmony of their
      temperaments. It no fault of either of them, they would agree; it was just
      that they were different. Thyrsis had a simile that he used&mdash;"It's a
      marriage between a butterfly and a hippopotamus. You don't blame the
      butterfly because it can't get down into the water and snort; and on the
      other hand, when the hippopotamus tries to flap his wings and flit about
      among the flowers, he doesn't make a success of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be times when he took Corydon's point of view entirely. She
      was beautiful and good; her naïveté and guilelessness were the essence of
      her charm and how preposterous it was to expect her to think about
      newspapers, or to be familiar with the price of beefsteaks! As for him&mdash;he
      was a blundering creature, dull and pragmatical; he was a great spiny
      monster that she had drawn up from the ocean-depths. She would cut off his
      spines, but at once they grew out again; she could do nothing with him at
      all!
    </p>
    <p>
      But then she would protest&mdash;"It's not so bad as that, Thyrsis. You
      have your work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it," he would answer. "My work! I'm just a thinking-machine.
      I'm fit for nothing else. And here I am&mdash;married!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would say that, and he would mean it; he would try to act upon the
      conviction. Of course Corydon's nature was a thing more lovely than his;
      and, of course, it ought to have its way, to grow in freedom and joy. But
      alas&mdash;there was "the economic screw"! His qualities&mdash;hateful
      though they might be&mdash;were the product of stern conditions; they were
      the qualities which had to dominate in their lives, if they were to
      survive in the grim struggle for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 14. It was, as always, their tragedy that they had no means of
      communicating, except through suffering; they had no work, and they had no
      art, and they had no religion. To Thyrsis it seemed that this last was the
      supreme need of their lives; but it was quite in vain that he tried to
      supply it. He had no theologies to offer, but he had a rough working faith
      that served his needs. He had a way of prayer&mdash;informal prayers, to
      the undiscovered gods&mdash;"Oh infinite Holiness of life, I seek to be
      reminded of Thee!" He would contemplate their failures and agonies and
      despairs, and floods of pity would well up in him; and then he would come
      back to Corydon, seeking to make these things real to her. But this he
      could never do&mdash;he could never carry her with him, he could never
      find anything with her but failure and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, in part, the outrage that the creed-mongers had done to her;
      with their dead formulas and their grotesque legends and their stupid
      bigotries they had sullied and defaced all the symbols of religion&mdash;they
      had made a noble temple into a sepulchre of dead bones. They had taken her
      by force, when she was a child, and dragged her into it, and filled her
      with terror and loathing. To abandon the language of metaphor, they had
      sent her to a Protestant-Episcopal Sunday-school, where a vinegary
      spinster had taught her the catechism and the ten commandments. And so
      forever after the whole content of Christianity was a thing alien and
      hateful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also, in their disharmony was something even more fundamental.
      Corydon's emotions did not come in the same way as her husband's. With her
      a joy had to be a spontaneous thing; there could be no reasoning about it,
      and it was not the product nor the occasion of any act of will. In fact,
      if anyone were to say to Corydon, "Come, let us experience a certain
      emotion"&mdash;then straightway it would become certain that she might
      experience any emotion in the world, save only that one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis told himself that he was to blame for this having destroyed her
      spontaneity in the very beginning But how was he to have known that,
      understanding as he did no temperament but his own, being powerless to
      handle any tools but his own? The process of his soul's life was to tell
      himself all his vices over; and so he would become filled with hatred of
      himself, and would forthwith evolve into something different. But with
      Corydon, this method produced, not rage and resolution, but only black
      despair. The process of Corydon's soul-life was that some one else should
      come to her, and tell her that she was radiant and exquisite; and
      straightway she would become these things, and yet more of them; and until
      such a person came to her, all her soul's life stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was illustrated whenever there was any misunderstanding between them,
      any crisis of unhappiness or fit of melancholia. It was quite in vain at
      such times that Thyrsis would ask her to sweep these things aside and
      forget them; it was disastrous to suggest that she put any blame upon
      herself, or scold herself into a different attitude. He might take days to
      make up his mind to do what he had to do&mdash;yet that fit of misery
      would last until he had come and done it. He had to put his arms about
      her, and make her realize that she was precious to him, that she was
      necessary to him, that he loved her and appreciated her and believed in
      her; so, and so only, would the current of her life begin once more to
      flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why could he not do this more quickly? Why did he have to wait until
      she had suffered agonies? Why did he have to be dragged to it by the hair
      of his head, as it were&mdash;as a means of keeping her from going insane
      from misery? Was it that he did not really love her? Mocking voices in his
      soul told him that was it&mdash;but he knew it was not so. He loved her;
      but he loved her in his way, and that was not her way. And how shall one
      explain that strange impulse in the heart of man, that makes it impossible
      for him to be content with anything that is upon the earth&mdash;that
      makes him restless in the presence of beauty and love and joy, and all
      those things with which he so obviously ought to be content?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so clearly irrational and unjustifiable; and yet that impulse
      continues to drive him forth, as it drove him to destroy the statues in
      the Athenian temples, and to burn the silken robes and the jewelled
      treasures in the public-squares of Venice. One contemplates the thing in
      its most unlovely aspects&mdash;in the form of Simeon Stylites upon his
      pillar, devoured by worms, or of Bernard Gui, with his racks and his
      thumb-screws and his "secular arm"&mdash;and it seems the very culmination
      of all human madness and horror. And yet, it does not cease to come; and
      he upon whom it seizes may not free himself by any power of his will, by
      any cunning of his wit; and no agony of yearning and grief may be
      sufficient to enable him to love a woman as a woman desires to be loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 15. Thyrsis would work over the book until he was utterly exhausted;
      and then, limp as a rag, he would come back to the world of reality and
      face these complications. He needed to rest, he needed to be soothed and
      comforted and sung to sleep; he needed to receive&mdash;and instead he had
      to give. Sometimes he wondered vaguely if this might not have been
      otherwise; he knew nothing about women&mdash;but surely there might have
      been, somewhere in the world, some woman who would have understood, and
      would have asked nothing from him. But he dwelt on that thought but
      seldom, for it seemed a kind of treason; he was not married to any such
      hypothetical woman&mdash;he was married to Corydon, and it was Corydon he
      had to save from the wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, time after time, he would come back to her, and take the cup of her
      pain in his trembling hands, and put it to his lips and drain it to the
      dregs. He would sit with her, and hear the tale of her struggles, he would
      fan the sparks of his exhausted emotions into flame, so that she might
      warm herself by the glow. And when the burden became too great for him,
      when the black floods of anguish and despair which she poured out upon him
      threatened to engulf him altogether&mdash;then he would tramp away into
      the forest, or out upon the snow-encrusted hills, and call up the demons
      of his soul once more, and proclaim himself unconquered and unconquerable.
      He would spread his wings to the glory of his vision; he would feel again
      the surge and sweep of it, he would sing aloud with the power of it, and
      pledge himself anew to live for it&mdash;if need be even to die for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world was trying to crush it in him; the world hated it and feared it,
      and was bound that it should not live; and Thyrsis had sworn to save it&mdash;and
      so the issue was joined. He would hearten himself for the struggle&mdash;he
      would fling himself into the thick of it, again and again; he would summon
      up that thing which he called his Genius, that fountain of endless force
      that boiled up within him. Whatever strength they brought against him, he
      could match it; he might be knocked down, trampled upon, left for dead
      upon the field, but he could rise and renew the conflict! He would talk to
      himself, he would call aloud to himself, he would repeat to himself
      formulas of exhortation, cries of defiance, proclamations of resolve. He
      would summon his enemies before him, sometimes in hosts, sometimes as
      individuals&mdash;all those who ever in his life had mocked and taunted
      him, scolded him and threatened him. He would shake his clenched fists at
      them; they might as well understand it&mdash;they could never conquer him,
      not all the power they could bring would suffice! He would call upon
      posterity also; he would summon his friends and lovers of the future, to
      give him comfort in his sore distress. Was it not for them that he was
      laboring&mdash;that they might some day feed their souls upon his faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis would think of the "Song of Roland", recalling that heroic figure
      and his three days' labor: when he had read that poem, his heart had
      seemed to throb with pain every time that Roland lifted his sword-arm. He
      would think of the old blind "Samson Agonistes"; he would think of the
      Greeks at Thermopylae, of the siege of Haarlem. History was full of such
      tales of the agonies that men had endured for the sake of their faith; and
      why should he expect exemption, why should he shrink from the fiery test?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 16. So he lived and fought two battles, one within and one without;
      and little by little these two became merged in his imagination. He had
      conceived a figure which should embody the War; and that figure had come
      to be himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The War of which he was writing had come upon a people unsuspecting and
      unprepared; they had not sought it nor desired it, they did not love it,
      they did not understand it. But the nation must be preserved; and so they
      set out to forge themselves into a sword. They had wealth, and they poured
      it out lavishly; and they had enthusiasm&mdash;whole armies of young men
      came forward. They were uniformed and armed and drilled and one after
      another they marched out, with banners waving, and drums rolling, and
      hearts beating high with hope; and one after another they met the enemy,
      and were swallowed up in carnage and destruction, and came reeling back in
      defeat and despair. It happened so often that the whole land moaned with
      the horror of it&mdash;there was Bull Run and then again Bull Run, and
      there was the long Peninsula Campaign&mdash;an entire year of futility and
      failure; and there was the ghastly slaughter of Fredericksburg, and the
      blind confusion of Chancellorsville, and the bitter, disappointment of
      Antietam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis wished to portray all this from the point of view of the humble
      private, who got none of the glory, and expected none, but only suffering
      and toil; whose lot it was to march and countermarch, to delve and sweat
      in the trenches, to be stifled by the heat and drenched by the rain and
      frozen by the cold; to wade through seas of blood and anguish, to be
      wounded and captured and imprisoned, to be lured by victory and blasted by
      defeat. And into it all he was pouring the distillation of his own
      experiences. For there was not much of it that he had not known in his own
      person. Surely he had known what it was to be cold and hungry; surely he
      had known what it was to be lured by victory and blasted by defeat. He had
      watched by the death-bed of his dearest dreams, he had listened to the
      moaning of multitudes of imprisoned hopes. He had known what it was to set
      before him a purpose, and to cling to it in spite of obloquy and hatred;
      he had known what it was to suffer until his forehead throbbed, and all
      things reeled and swam before his eyes. He had known also what it was to
      sacrifice for the sake of the future, and to see others, who thought of no
      one but themselves, preying upon him, and upon the community, and living
      in luxury and enjoying power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, as he studied this War, Thyrsis had come upon a strange
      and sinister fact about it. Roughly speaking, the population of the
      country might have been divided into two classes. There were those to whom
      the Union was precious, and who gave their labor and their lives for it;
      they starved and fought and agonized for it, and came home, worn, often
      crippled, and always poor. On the other hand there were some who had cared
      nothing for the Union, but were finding their chance to grow rich and to
      establish themselves in the places of power. They were selling shoddy
      blankets and paper shoes to the government; they were speculating in
      cotton and gold and food. There were a few exceptions to this, of course;
      but for the most part, when one came to study the gigantic fortunes which
      were corrupting the nation, he discovered that it was just here they had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was the curious and ironic fact; the nation had been saved&mdash;but
      only to be handed over to the money-changers! And these now possessed it
      and dominated it; and a new generation had come forward, which knew not
      how these things had come to be&mdash;which knew only the money-changers
      and their power. And who was there to tell them of the War, and all that
      the War had meant? Who was there to make that titan agony real to them, to
      point them to the high destinies of the Republic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with his war-books, Thyrsis was reading his daily newspaper, which
      came to him freighted with the cynicism of the hour. It was when the
      revelations of corruption in business and political affairs were at their
      flood; high and low, in towns and cities, in states and in the nation
      itself, one saw that the government of the country had been bought.
      Everywhere throughout the land Mammon sat upon the throne, and men cringed
      before him&mdash;there was only persecution and mockery for those who
      believed in the things for which America stood to all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this new Lord, who had purchased the people, and held them in bond,
      was extracting a toll of suffering and privation, of accident and disease
      and death, that was worse than the agony of many wars. The whole land was
      groaning and sweating beneath the burden of it; and Thyrsis, who shared
      the pain, and knew the meaning of it, was sick with the responsibility it
      put upon him, yearning for a thousand voices with which he might cry the
      truth aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one must bring America face to face with its soul again; and who was
      there to do it&mdash;who was there that was even trying? Thyrsis had seen
      the statues of St. Gaudens, and he knew there was one man who had dreamed
      the dream of his country. But who was there to put it into song, or into
      story, that the young might read? Like the newspapers and the churches,
      the authors had sold out; they were writing for matinée-girls, and for the
      Pullman-car book-trade; and meantime the civilization of America was
      sliding down into the pit!
    </p>
    <p>
      So here again was War! Here again were pain and sickness, hunger and cold,
      solitude and despair, to be endured and defied; death itself to be faced&mdash;madness
      even, and soul-decay! Armies of men had gone out, had laid themselves down
      and filled up the ditches with their bodies, to make a bridge for Freedom
      to pass on. And the ditches were not yet full&mdash;another life was
      needed!

    <p>
      Nor must he think himself too good for the sacrifice; there had been
      greater men than he, no doubt, burned up in the Wilderness, and blown to
      pieces by the cannon at "Bloody Angle"; there had been dreamers of mighty
      dreams among them&mdash;and they were dead, and all their dreams were
      dead. And neither must he love his own too dearly; there had been women
      who had suffered and died in that War, and babes who had perished by tens
      of thousands; and they, too, had been born with agony, had been loved and
      yearned for, and wept and prayed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, out of the dead past, were voices calling to Thyrsis; he heard them in
      the night&mdash;time as one mighty symphony of grief. They had died for
      nothing, unless the Republic should be saved, unless their dream of
      freedom and justice could be made real. And for what was the poet but
      that? So that the new generations might know what their fathers had done&mdash;that
      the youth of America might be roused and thrilled once more! Surely it
      could not be that the land was all sunk in selfishness and unfaith&mdash;that
      there were no longer any generous souls who could be stirred by a
      trumpet-call, and led forth to strike a new blow for the great hope of
      Humanity!
    </p>

      Section 17. The long winter dragged by, and the fury of it seemed to
      increase; they were as if besieged by demons of cold and storm. There came
      another blizzard, and the snows drifted down to their hollow by the edge
      of the woods, so that it was two days before they could get out, even to
      the farm-house. And there was no place for them to walk&mdash;a path from
      their house to Thyrsis' study was a labor of half a day to dig. Also
      Corydon caught a cold, which ran in due course through the little family,
      and added to their misery and discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow seemed to be symbolical, walling them in from all the world.
      "There is no help", it seemed to say to them; whatever strength they got
      they must wring out of their own hearts. Here in this place, it seemed to
      Thyrsis, he learned the real meaning of Winter; he saw it as primitive man
      had seen it, a cruel and merciless assailant, a fiend that came ravening,
      dealing destruction and death. He thought of the ode by Thomas Campbell&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Archangel! Power of desolation!
        Fast descending as thou art,
    Say, hath mortal invocation
        Spells to touch thy stony heart?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Surely no Runic Odin, who "howled his war-song to the gale", no Lapland
      savage who cowered in his hut, ever panted for the respite of the
      spring-time more than these two lovers in their tiny cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Corydon was going down-hill under the strain. She
      became more and more nervous and wretched, her headaches and her fits of
      exhaustion were more frequent. Then, too, her old mental trouble, the
      habit of "thinking things", was plaguing her again&mdash;She would come to
      Thyrsis with long accounts of her psychological entanglements, and he
      would patiently unravel the skein. Or sometimes, if he was very tired, he
      might give some signs of a desire to escape the ordeal; and then he would
      see a look of terror stealing into Corydon's eyes. So these things were
      real after all&mdash;they were real even to Thyrsis!
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he opened his eyes, and looked from his study-window, to find
      that another heavy snow had fallen; and when he had dressed and gone over
      to the house, he found Corydon in bed. She complained of a headache, and
      had had chills during the night, and was now quite evidently feverish. He
      was alarmed, and after he had made her as comfortable as he could, he
      dressed the baby and took him upon his shoulder, and made his way with
      difficulty to the farm-house. He left the baby there, and with a horse and
      sleigh set out for town. The horse had to walk all the way, and several
      times the sleigh was upset in the drifts, so that it was two hours before
      he reached his destination. As the doctor was out upon his rounds, he had
      to wait a couple of hours more&mdash;and then only to learn that the man
      could not possibly attempt the trip. He had several patients who were
      dangerously ill, and he had to be on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent Thyrsis to another doctor, but this one said exactly the same; and
      so the boy spent the day wandering about the town. The thought of
      Corydon's lying there alone, helpless and suffering, made him wild; but
      everywhere he met with the same response&mdash;the cold weather had
      apparently brought an epidemic of disease, and there was no doctor in the
      place who could spare three or four hours to make the long journey in the
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was nothing for him to do but go back. The farmer's wife offered
      to take care of the baby over night, and he went down to the cottage alone
      where he found Corydon much worse. He sat and held her hand, a terror
      clutching at his heart; and all night long he sat and tended her&mdash;he
      filled hot water bottles when she was chilled, and got ice when she was
      hot, and made cool lemonade, and prepared tidbits and tempted her to eat.
      He would whisper to her and soothe her; and later, when she fell into a
      doze, he sat nodding in his chair and shivering with cold, but afraid to
      touch the fire for fear of disturbing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, towards dawn, she wakened; and Thyrsis was almost beside himself
      with anguish and fear&mdash;for she was delirious, and did not know where
      she was, or what she was doing. She kept talking as if to the baby&mdash;in
      their baby-talk. Thyrsis would listen, until he would choke up with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her, and went up to the farm, and got the horse and sleigh again,
      and drove to another town. It made no difference what doctor he got&mdash;to
      Thyrsis all doctors were alike, the keepers of the keys of health. After
      several hours' pursuit he found that this man also was busy. All he could
      say was that he would try to get out that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went back again, to find his wife with flushed face, and beads
      of perspiration upon her forehead; now sitting up and babbling aimlessly,
      now sinking back exhausted. He sat once more through a night of torment,
      holding her hot hands in his, and praying in vain for the coming of the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon of the next day before the man finally came, and brought
      some relief to Thyrsis' soul, and perhaps also to Corydon's body. He took
      her temperature and listened to her breathing, and pronounced it a severe
      attack of grippe, with a touch of bronchitis; and he laid out an
      assortment of capsules and liquids, and promised to come again if Thyrsis
      sent for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the boy set out in the double role of trained nurse and mother's
      assistant. He gave Corydon her medicines, and brought fresh water for her,
      and smoothed her pillows and talked to her, and prepared some delicacies
      for her when she wished to eat; also he dressed and bathed the baby, and
      cooked his complex meals and fed them to him; he put on his rubbers and
      his leggings and his mittens, and the overcoat and peaked hood (which
      Corydon had devised for him out of eighty cents' worth of woolly red
      cloth), and turned him out to "bongie cowtoos" in the snow. Likewise he
      got his own meals and washed the dishes, and tended the fires and emptied
      the ashes and filled the lamps and swept the floors; and in the interim
      between these various duties he fought new battles within himself, and got
      new side-lights upon Chickamauga and "Bloody Angle".
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 18. It was two weeks before this siege was lifted, and Corydon was
      able to take up her burdens once more. It was then March, and the snow had
      given place to cold sleety rains, and the fields and the ground about
      their home were miniature swamps full of mud. Thyrsis would tramp through
      this to the hill-tops where the storm-winds howled, and there vow defiance
      to his foes, and come home to pour new hope and courage and resolution
      into a bottomless pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was finishing his vision of the field of Gettysburg&mdash;the
      three-days' grapple between two titan armies, that meant to him three
      weeks of soul-terrifying toil. Men had said that Gettysburg meant the
      turning Of the tide, that victory was certain; and yet there had followed
      Sherman's long campaign, and all the horror of the Wilderness fighting,
      and Mine Run and Cold Harbor and the ghastly siege of Petersburg. And now
      Thyrsis had to fight his way through this. He saw the figure that he had
      dreamed, and that possessed him; a soldier who was the rage of the War
      incarnate, the awakened frenzy of the nation. He was a man lifted above
      pain and cold and hunger; he was gaunt and wild of aspect, restless and
      impatient, driving, driving to the end. He went about the duties of the
      camp like one in a dream; he marched like an automaton&mdash;for hours, or
      for days, as need might be&mdash;his thoughts flying on to those moments
      that alone were real to him, to the charge and the fury of the conflict,
      the blows that were the only things that counted. He lived amid sights and
      sounds of horror, with groans and weeping in his ears, with a mist of
      blood and cannon-smoke before his eyes; he drove on, grim and implacable,
      the very ground about him rocking and quivering in a delirium of torment.
      He was the War!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Corydon was growing paler, and more wretched than ever. For her,
      too, this winter was symbolized as a battle-ground. To him it was a field
      in which armies clashed, and the issue was uncertain; but to her it was a
      field of inevitable defeat, strewn with the corpses of her hopes. For
      hours she would lie upon her couch in the night-watches, silent, alone,
      staring out of the window at the wide waste of snow in the pitiless
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis would have preferred to sleep in his own study, as he worked so
      late at night; but Corydon begged him not to do this, she would rather be
      wakened, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on one occasion, he came over at about two o'clock in the morning, and
      found her sleeping, as he thought, and crawled into his own cot. He was
      just dozing off to sleep, when he heard what he thought was a stifled sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened; he thought that she was crying in her sleep. But then, as the
      sound grew clearer, he sat up. The moonlight was shining in upon her, and
      Thyrsis caught a bright glint of steel. Swift as a flash the meaning of
      that swept over him. He had provided her with a revolver, that she might
      feel safe when she was left alone; and now he bounded out of bed and
      sprang across the room, and found her with the weapon pointed at her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck it away; and Corydon, with a terrified cry, clutched at him and
      collapsed in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Thyrsis!" she wailed. "Save me! Save me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't do it!" she cried, choking. "I couldn't! I tried&mdash;I tried
      so hard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweetheart", he whispered, in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let me do it!" she sobbed. "Oh, Thyrsis, you must save me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her to his bosom, shuddering with dread, and trying to soothe
      her hysterical outburst. So, little by little, he dragged the story from
      her. For three days she had been making up her mind to shoot herself, and
      she had chosen that night for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been sitting here for an hour," she whispered&mdash;"with the
      revolver in my hand. And I couldn't get up the courage to pull the
      trigger."
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped her, white with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard you coming," she went on. "I lay and pretended to sleep. Then I
      tried again&mdash;but I can't, I can't! I'm a coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was only one thing that stopped me. You would have got on without
      me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, dearest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would&mdash;I know it! I'm only in your way. But oh, my baby! I loved
      him so, and I couldn't bear to leave him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him convulsively. "Oh, Thyrsis," she panted, "think what it
      meant to me to leave him. He'd have been without a mother all his life!
      And something might have happened to you, and he'd have had no one to love
      him at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you want to do it?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Thyrsis, I've suffered so! I'm weary&mdash;I'm worn out&mdash;I'm sick
      of the fight. I can't stand it any more&mdash;and what can I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor, poor girl," he whispered, and pressed her to his heart in a
      paroxysm of grief. "Oh, my Corydon! My Corydon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror of the thing overwhelmed him; he began to weep himself&mdash;his
      frame was shaken with tearless, agonizing sobs. What could he do for her,
      how could he help her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But already he had helped her; it was not often that she saw him weeping,
      it was not often she found that she could do something for <i>him</i>.
      "Thyrsis, do you really <i>want</i> me?" she whispered. "Do you truly love
      me that much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, I love you!" he sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she replied, "Then I'll stay. I'll bear anything, if you need me&mdash;if
      I can be of any use at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 19. So their tears were mingled; so once more, being sufficiently
      plowed up with agony, they might behold the deeps of each other's souls.
      Being at their last gasp, and driven to desperation, they would make the
      convulsive effort, and break the crust of dullness and commonplace, and
      reveal again the mighty forces hidden in their depths. At such hours he
      beheld Corydon as she was, the flaming spirit, the archangel prisoned in
      the flesh. If only he could have found the key to those deep chambers, so
      that he could have had access to them always!
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, they knew only one path that led to them, and that through the
      valley of despair. From despair it led to anguished struggle, and from
      struggle to defiance, to rage and denunciation&mdash;and thence to visions
      and invocations, raptures and enthralments. So this night, for instance,
      behold Corydon, first holding her husband's hands, and shuddering with
      awe, and pledging her faith all over again; and then, later on, when the
      dawn was breaking, sitting in the cold moonlight with a blanket flung
      about her, her wild hair tossing, and in her hand the revolver with which
      she had meant to destroy herself. Behold her, making sport of her own
      life-drama&mdash;turning into wildest phantasy her domestic ignominies,
      her inhibitions and her helpmate's blunderings; evoking the hosts of the
      future as to a festival, rehearsing the tragedy of her soul with all
      posterity as her audience. When once these mad steeds of her fancy were
      turned loose, one could never tell where their course would be; and
      strange indeed were the adventures that came to him who rode with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be no limit to the powers of this subliminal woman within
      Corydon. Her cheeks would kindle, her eyes would blaze, and eloquence
      would pour from her&mdash;the language of great poetry, fervid and
      passionate, with swift flashes of insight and illumination, tumultuous
      invocations and bursts of prophecy. Thyrsis would listen and marvel. What
      a mind she had&mdash;sharp, like a rapier, swift as the lightning-flash!
      The powers of penetration and understanding, and above all the sheer
      splendors of language&mdash;the blazes of metaphor, the explosions of
      coruscating wit! What a tragic actress she might have made&mdash;how she
      would have shaken men's souls, and set them to shuddering with terror!
      What an opera-singer she could have been, with that rich vibrant voice,
      and the mien of a disinherited goddess!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was out of such hours that the faith of their lives was made; and it
      was out of them also that Thyrsis formed his idea of woman. To him woman
      was an equal; and this he not only said with his lips, he lived it in his
      feelings. The time came when he went out into the world, and learned to
      understand the world's idea, that woman meant vanity and pettiness and
      frivolity; but Thyrsis let all this pass, knowing the woman-soul.
      Somewhere underneath, not yet understood and mastered, was pent this
      mighty force that in the end would revolutionize all human ideas and
      institutions. Here was faith, here was vision, here was the power of all
      powers; and how was it to be delivered and made conscious, and brought
      into the service of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most women liked Thyrsis, because they divined in some vague way this
      attitude; and some men hated him for the same reason. These men, Thyrsis
      observed, were the slave-drivers; they held that woman was the weaker
      vessel, and for this they had their own motives. There were women, too,
      who liked to be ruled; but Thyrsis never argued with them&mdash;it was
      enough, he judged, to treat any slave as a free man, or any servant as a
      gentleman, and sooner or later they would divine what he meant, and the
      spirit of revolt would begin to flicker.

      BOOK XIII. THE MASTERS OF THE SNARE
    </h2>

      <i>They stood upon the porch of the little cabin, listening to the silence
      of the night. </i>
    </p>

      "How far away it all seems!" she said&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      "It makes one feel old," he said&mdash;"like the coming of the night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The night!" she repeated, and went on&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           "I feel her finger light
    Laid pausefully upon life's headlong train;&mdash;
        The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,
        The heart less bounding at emotion new,
    And hope once crush'd less quick to spring again!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. Throughout this long winter of discontent came to them one ray of
      hope from the outside world. "The Genius" was given in the little town in
      Germany, and Thyrsis' correspondent sent the twenty-five dollars, and
      wrote that it had made a great impression, and that more performances were
      to be expected. Then, after an interval, Thyrsis was surprised to receive
      from his clipping-bureau some items to the effect that his play was to be
      produced in one of the leading theatres in Berlin. He wrote to his
      correspondent for an explanation, and learned to his dismay that his play
      had been "pirated"; it was, of course, not copyright in Germany, and so he
      had no redress, and must content himself with what his friend referred to
      as "the renowns which will be brought to you by these performances".
    </p>
    <p>
      The play came out, in the early spring, and apparently made a considerable
      sensation. Thyrsis read long reviews from the German papers, and there
      were accounts of it in several American papers. So people began to ask who
      this unknown poet might be. The publishers of "The Hearer of Truth" were
      moved to venture new advertisements of the book&mdash;whereby they sold
      perhaps a hundred copies more; and Thyrsis was moved to pay some badly&mdash;needed
      money to have more copies of the play made, so that he might try to
      interest some other manager. He carried on a long correspondence with a
      newly-organized "stage society", which thought a great deal about trying
      the play at a matinée, but did nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, Thyrsis received a letter from one of the country's popular
      novelists, who had heard of the play abroad, and asked to read it. When he
      had read it and told what an interesting piece of work it was, Thyrsis sat
      down and wrote the great man about his plight, and asked for help; which
      led to correspondence, and to the passing round of the manuscript among a
      group of literary people. One of these was Haddon Channing, the critic and
      essayist, who was interested enough to write Thyrsis several long letters,
      and to read the rest of his productions, and later on to call to see him.
      Which, visit proved a curious experience for the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived one day towards spring, when it chanced that Corydon was in
      town visiting the dentist. Thyrsis had just finished his dinner when he
      saw two people coming through the orchard, and he leaped up in haste to
      put the soiled dishes away, and make the place as presentable as possible.
      Mr. and Mrs. Channing had come in their car (they lived in Philadelphia),
      and were followed by an escort of the farmer's children&mdash;since an
      automobile was a rare phenomenon in that neighborhood. The entrance to the
      peach-orchard proved not wide enough for the machine, so they had to get
      out and walk; and this they found annoying, because the ground was wet and
      soft. All of which seemed to emphasize the incongruity of their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haddon Channing might have been described as a dilettante radical. He
      employed a highly-wrought and artificial style, which scintillated with
      brilliant epigram; one had a feeling that it rather atoned for the evils
      in human life, that they became the occasion of so much cleverness in
      Channing's books. Perhaps that was the reason why most people did not
      object to the vagueness of his ideas, when it came to any constructive
      suggestion. In fact he rather made a point of such vagueness&mdash;when
      you tried to do anything about a social evil, that was politics, and
      politics were vulgar. One could never pin Channing down, but his idea
      seemed to be that in the end all men would become free and independent
      spirits, able to make their own epigrams; after which there would be no
      more evil in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here he was in the flesh. It seemed to Thyrsis as if he must have made
      a study of his own books, and then proceeded to fit his person and his
      clothing, his accent and his manner, to make a proper setting thereto. He
      was tall and lean, immaculate and refined; he spoke with airy and
      fastidious grace, pouring out one continuous stream of cleverness&mdash;any
      hour of his conversation was equivalent to a volume of his works at a
      dollar and a quarter net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there was Mrs. Channing, gracious and exquisite, looking as if she
      had stepped out of one of Rossetti's poems. She was a poetess herself;
      writing about Acteon, and Antinoüs, and other remote subjects. Thyrsis
      assumed that there must be something in these poems, for they were given
      two or three pages in the thirty-five-cent magazines; but he himself had
      never discovered any reason why he should read one through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. They seated themselves upon his six-foot piazza; and Thyrsis, who
      had very little sense of personality, and was altogether wrapped up in
      ideas, was soon in the midst of a free and easy discussion with them. It
      seemed ages since he had had an opportunity to exchange opinions with
      anyone except Corydon. With these people he roamed over the fields of
      literature; and as they found nothing to agree about anywhere, the
      conversation did not flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange experience it must have been to them, to come to a lonely shanty
      in the woods, and encounter a haggard boy, in a cotton-shirt and a pair of
      frayed trousers, who was all oblivious of their elegance, and unawed by
      their reputation, and who behaved like a bull in the china-shop of their
      orderly opinions. Mrs. Channing, it seemed, was completing her life-work,
      a volume which was to revolutionize current criticism, and lead the world
      back to artistic health; to her, modern civilization was a vast abortion,
      and in Greek culture was to be sought the fountain-head of health. She
      sang the praises of Athenian literature and art and life; there was sanity
      and clarity, there was balance and serenity! And to compare it with the
      jangled confusion and the frantic strife of modern times!
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Thyrsis answered, "We'd best let modern times alone. For here
      you've all facts and no generalization; and in the case of the Greeks
      you've all generalization and no facts."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they went at it, hot and heavy. Mrs. Channing, her Greek serenity
      somewhat ruffled, insisted that she had studied the facts for herself. The
      other proceeded to probe into her equipment, and found that she knew Homer
      and Sophocles, but did not know Aristophanes so well, and did not know the
      Greek epigrams at all. Thyrsis maintained that the dominant note in the
      Greek heritage was one of bewilderment and despair; in support of which
      alarming opinion he carried the discussion from the dreams of Greek
      literature to the realities of Greek life. Did Mrs. Channing know how the
      Greeks had persecuted all their great thinkers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she know anything about the cruelties of their slave-code?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever studied Greek politics?" he asked. "Do you realize, for
      instance, that it was the custom of statesmen and generals who were
      defeated by their political rivals, to go over to the enemy and lead an
      expedition against their homes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that putting it rather strongly?" asked Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so," he answered. "Didn't the conquerors of both Salamis
      and Platasa afterwards sell out to the Persian king? And then you talk
      about the noble ideal of woman which the Greeks developed! Don't you know
      that it was nothing but a literary tradition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had never understood that," said Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the other answered: "It was handed down from imaginary Homeric
      days. The Greek lady of the Periclean age was a domestic prisoner and
      drudge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Then, late in the afternoon, came Corydon; and this part of the
      adventure must have seemed stranger yet to the Channings. Corydon wore a
      shirt-waist and a ten-cent straw hat, trimmed with some white
      mosquito-netting, and an old blue skirt which she had worn before her
      marriage, and had enlarged little by little during the period of her
      pregnancy, and had taken in again after the baby was born. Also she was
      pale and sad-looking, much startled by the sight of the automobile, and
      the sudden apparition of elegance. She got rid of her armfuls of groceries
      and bundles, and seated herself in an inconspicuous place, and sat
      listening while the argument went on. For a full hour she never uttered a
      word; only once during the controversy over the "Greek lady", Mrs.
      Channing turned to her and asked, "Don't you agree with me?" But Corydon
      could only answer, "I don't know, I have not read much history." And who
      was there to tell the visitor that this strange, wide-eyed girl knew more
      about the tragedies and terrors of the Greek temperament than she with all
      her culture and her college-degrees could have learned in many life-times?
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stayed to supper, and Corydon and Thyrsis set out the meal upon
      the rustic outdoor table; they apologized for their domestic inadequacies,
      but Mrs. Channing declared that she "adored picknicking". The evening was
      spent in more discussion; and finally it was decided that the visitors
      should stay over night at the hotel in town, and come out again in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis concluded, as he thought the matter over, that the two must have
      been fascinated by this domestic situation, and curious to look deeper
      into it. Perhaps they saw "material" in it; or perhaps it was that Haddon
      Channing was really impressed by Thyrsis' powers, and sought to understand
      his problems and help him. Whatever may have been the motive for it, when
      they came the next morning, the critic took Thyrsis for a walk in the
      woods and proceeded to discuss his affairs. And meanwhile his wife had set
      herself to the task of probing the innermost corners of Corydon's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burden of Channing's discourse was Thyrsis' impatience and lack of
      balance, his fanaticism and his too great opinion of his own work. "My
      dear fellow," he said, "you are the most friendless human being I have
      ever encountered upon earth. How can you expect to interest men if you
      don't get out into the world and learn what they are doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means to get a position, I suppose?" said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not necessarily&mdash;" began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I haven't money to live in the city otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was too definite for Channing, and he went off on another tack. He
      had been reading "The Higher Cannibalism", and he could not forgive it. A
      boy of Thyrsis' age had no right to be seething with such bitterness;
      there must be some fundamental and terrible cause. He was destroying
      himself, he was eating out his heart in this isolation; he was so wrapped
      up in his own miseries, his own wrongs&mdash;in all the concerns of his
      own exaggerated ego!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated beside a little streamlet in the woods. "What you need is
      something to get you out of yourself," the critic was saying&mdash;"something
      to restore your sanity and balance. It'll come to you some day. Perhaps
      it'll be a love-affair&mdash;you'll meet some woman who'll carry you away.
      I know the sort you need&mdash;they grow in the West&mdash;the great
      brooding type of woman-soul, that would fold you in her arms and give you
      a little peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was silent for a space. "You forget," he said, in a low voice,
      "that I am already married."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shrugged his shoulders. "Such things have happened, even so," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had taken his part in the conversation before this, defending
      himself and setting forth his point of view. But now he fell silent. The
      words had cut him to the quick. It seemed to him an insult and a bitter
      humiliation; here, at his home, almost in the presence of his wife! What
      was the man's idea, anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he turned upon Channing with the question, "You think that
      I've married a doll?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was staggered for a moment. "I don't know what you've married,"
      he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Thyrsis. "Then how can you advise me in such a matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that you're not happy&mdash;" the other began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the boy. "But I don't want any more women."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, while Thyrsis sat pondering, Should he try to explain
      to this man? But he shook his head. No, it would be useless to try. "She
      is not in your class," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has none of your culture, none of your social graces. She can't
      write, and she can't sing&mdash;she can't do anything that your wife
      does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid," said Channing, in a low voice, "you don't take my remarks in
      the right spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even suppose that she were not what you call a 'great woman-soul',"
      persisted Thyrsis&mdash;"at least she has starved and suffered for me; and
      wouldn't common loyalty bind me to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have tried to do something very difficult," said the other, after a
      silence. "I have tried to talk to you frankly. It is the most thankless
      task in the world to tell a man his own faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Thyrsis. "And that's all right&mdash;I'm perfectly willing.
      I don't mind knowing my faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is evident that you have resented it," declared the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis answered with a laugh, "Don't you admit of replies to your
      criticisms? Suppose I'm pointing out some of your faults&mdash;your faults
      as a critic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Channing said that he did not object to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," said Thyrsis. "I simply tell you that you have missed
      the point of my trouble. There's nothing the matter with me but poverty
      and lack of opportunity; and there's nothing else the matter with my wife.
      We're doing our best, and it's the simple fact that we've endured and
      dared more than anybody we've ever met. And that's all there is to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Channing was deeply hurt. He turned the conversation
      to other matters, and pretty soon they got up and strolled on. When they
      came near to the house, he went off to see his chauffeur, and Thyrsis
      stood watching him, and pondering over the episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same thing that had happened to him in the city; it was the
      thing that would be happening to him all the time. He saw that however
      wretched he might be with Corydon, he would always take her part against
      the world. Whatever her faults might be, they were not such as the world
      could judge. Rather would he make it the test of a person's character,
      that they should understand and appreciate her, in spite of her lack of
      that superficial thing called culture&mdash;the ability to rattle off
      opinions about any subject under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that loyalty to Corydon held him fast. So her temperament was
      his law, and her needs were his standards; and day by day he must become
      more like her, and less like himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. He returned to the house, entering by the rear door. The baby was
      lying in the room asleep, and out upon the piazza, he could hear Corydon
      and Mrs. Channing. Corydon was speaking, in her intense voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble with me," she was saying, "is that I have no confidence!
      Other women are sure of themselves&mdash;they are self-contained, serene,
      satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why shouldn't you be that way?" Thus Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I aim too high," said Corydon. "I want too much. I defeat myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other, "but why&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been the circumstances of all my life! I've been defeated&mdash;thwarted&mdash;repressed!
      Everything drives me back into myself. There is nothing I can <i>do</i>&mdash;I
      can only endure and suffer and wait. So all the influences in my life are
      negative&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'I was sick with the Nay of life&mdash;
    With my lonely soul's refrain!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "What is that you are quoting?" asked Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's from a poem I wrote," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you write poetry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't say that," was the reply. "I have no technique&mdash;I never
      studied anything about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you try sometimes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I find it helps me," said Corydon&mdash;"once in a great while I find
      lines in my mind; and I put them together, so that I can say them over,
      and remind myself of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Mrs. Channing. "Tell me the poem you quoted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't believe you'd think much of it," said Corydon,
      hesitating. "I never expected anybody&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd be interested to hear it," declared her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Corydon recited in a low voice a couple of stanzas which had come to
      her in the lonely midnight hours. Thyrsis listened with interest&mdash;he
      had never heard them before:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "What matters the tired heart,
        What matters the weary brain?
    What matters the cruel smart
        Of the burden borne again?

    I was sick with the Nay of life&mdash;
        With my lonely soul's refrain;
    But the essence of love is strife,
        And the meaning of life is pain."
</pre>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "Do you&mdash;do you think that is worth while at all?"
      asked Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is evidently sincere," replied Mrs. Channing. "I think you ought to
      study and practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make much effort at it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other went on: "What concerns me is the attitude to life it shows.
      It is terrible that a young girl should feel that way. You must not let
      yourself get into such a state!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can I help it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have something that occupies your mind! That is what you need,
      truly it is! You've got to stop thinking about yourself&mdash;you've got
      to get outside yourself, somehow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis caught his breath. He could tell from the tone of the speaker's
      voice that she was laboring with Corydon, putting forth all her energies
      to impress her. He was tempted to step forward and cry out, "No, no!
      That's not the way! That won't work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead, he stood rooted to the spot, while Mrs. Channing went on&mdash;"This
      unhappiness comes from the fact that you are so self-centred. You must get
      some constructive work, my dear, if it's only training your baby. You must
      realize that you are not the only person who has troubles in the world.
      Why, I know a poor washerwoman, who was left a widow with four children to
      care for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly Thyrsis heard a voice cry out in anguish, "Oh, oh!
      stop!" He heard his wife spring up from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't listen to you any more!" cried Corydon. "You don't know what
      you're saying!&mdash;You don't understand me at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "I'm sorry you feel that," said Mrs. Channing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no right to talk to you!" exclaimed the other. "There's no one can
      understand! I have to fight alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Thyrsis went into the kitchen, and made some noise that they
      would hear. Then he called, "Are you there, dearest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Corydon; and he went out upon the piazza. He saw her standing,
      white and tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you still talking?" he said, with forced carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Mrs. Channing answered "Yes," Corydon said, quickly, "Excuse me a
      moment," and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the poet sat and talked with his guest about the state of the weather
      and the condition of the roads; until at last her husband arrived, saying
      that it was time they were starting. Corydon did not appear again, and so
      finally Thyrsis accompanied them out to their car, and saw them start off.
      They promised to come again, but he knew they would not keep that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. He went back to the house, and after some search he found Corydon
      down in the woods, whither she had fled to have out her agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has that woman gone?" she panted, when he came near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear," he said. "She's gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Corydon. "How dared she! How dared she!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, sweetheart," said Thyrsis. "The ground is wet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone off in her automobile!" exclaimed the girl, passionately. "She
      spent last night at a hotel that charged twelve dollars a day, and then
      she told me about her washerwoman! Now she's gone back to her beautiful
      home, with servants and a governess and a piano and everything else she
      wants! And she talked to me about 'occupation'! What <i>right</i> had she
      to come here and trample on my face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did you let her, dearest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I <i>help</i> myself? I had no idea&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did you get started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've nobody to confide in&mdash;nobody!" cried Corydon. "And she wanted
      to know about me&mdash;she led me on. I thought she sympathized with me&mdash;I
      thought she understood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a woman of the world, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was just pulling me to pieces! She wanted to see how I worked! Don't
      you see what she was looking for, Thyrsis&mdash;she thought I was <i>material!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She only writes about the Greeks," said Thyrsis, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a horrible example! I'm neurasthenic and self-centred&mdash;I'm the
      modern woman! She read me a long lecture like that! I ought to get busy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest!" he pleaded, trying to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Busy"! repeated Corydon, laughing hysterically. "Busy! I wash and dress
      and amuse a baby! I get six meals a day for him, I get three meals for us,
      and clean up everything. And the rest of the day I'm so exhausted I can
      hardly stand up, and a good part of the time I'm sick besides. And then,
      if I think about my troubles, it's because I've nothing to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," Thyrsis replied, "you should not have put yourself at her
      mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I hate her!" cried Corydon. "How I <i>hate</i> her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must learn to protect yourself from such people, Corydon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't meet them at all! I'm not able to face them&mdash;I've none of
      their weapons, none of their training. I don't want to know about them, or
      their kind of life! They have no souls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't easy for them to understand," said Thyrsis. "They have never
      been poor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That woman talks about the Greek love of beauty! What sacrifice has she
      ever made for beauty&mdash;what agony has she ever dared for it? And yet
      she can prattle about it&mdash;the phrases roll from her! She's been
      educated&mdash;polished&mdash;finished! She's been taught just what to
      say! And I haven't been taught, and so she despises me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's deeper than that, my dear," he said. "You have something in you that
      she would hate instinctively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've told you before, dearest. It's genius, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Genius! But what use is it to me, if it is? It only unfits me for life.
      It eats me up, it destroys me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day," he said, "you will find a way to express it. It will come,
      never fear.&mdash;But now, dear, be sensible. The ground is wet, and if
      you sit there, you will surely be laid up with rheumatism."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her up; but she was not to be diverted. Suddenly she turned, and
      caught him by the arms. "Thyrsis!" she cried. "Tell me! Do you blame me as
      she does? Do you think I'm weak and incompetent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever answer he might have been inclined to make, he saw in her wild
      eyes that only one answer was to be thought of. "Certainly not, my dear!"
      he said, quickly. "How could you ask me such a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, tell me! tell me!" she exclaimed. And so he had to go on, and sing
      the song of their love to her, and pour out balm upon her wounded spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards he went alone; and then it was not so simple. Little demons
      of doubt came and tormented him. Might it not be that there was something
      in the point of view of the Channings? He took Corydon at her own estimate&mdash;at
      the face value of her emotions; but might it not be that he was deluding
      himself, that he was a victim of his own infatuation?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would ponder this; he tried to have it out with himself for once. What
      did he really think about it? What would he have told Corydon if he had
      told her the bald truth? But such doubts could not stay with him for long.
      They brought shame to him. He was like a man travelling across the plains,
      who comes upon the woman he loves, being tortured by a band of Apaches;
      and who is caught and bound fast, to watch the proceedings. Would such a
      man spend his time asking whether the woman was weak and incompetent? No&mdash;his
      energies would be given to getting his arms loose, and finding out where
      the guns were. He would set her free, and give her a chance; and then it
      would be time enough to measure her powers and pass judgment upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. It was a long time before the family got over that visitation.
      Corydon burned all Channing's books and she wrote a long and indignant
      letter to Mrs. Channing, and then burned the letter. Thyrsis never told
      her about his conversation with the husband, for he knew she would never
      get over that insult. For himself, he concluded that the Channings were
      lucky in having got into a quarrel with them, as otherwise he would surely
      have compelled them to lend him some money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the advent of some fairy-godmother or Lady Bountiful was badly
      needed just then. They had struggled desperately to keep within the
      thirty-dollar limit, but it could no longer be done. Illnesses were
      expensive luxuries; and there was the typwriting of the book&mdash;some
      twenty dollars so far; also, there were many things that happened when one
      was running a household&mdash;a tooth-ache, or a telegram, or a hot-water
      bottle that got a hole in it, or a horse that ran away and broke a shaft.
      Little by little the bills they had been obliged to run up at the grocer's
      and the butcher's and the doctor's had been getting beyond the limits of
      their monthly check; and to cap the climax, there came a letter from Henry
      Darrell, saying that the next two checks would be the last he could
      possibly send.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis set to work once more at the shell of that tough old oyster,
      the world. He made out a "scenario" of the rest of his new book, and sent
      it with the part he had already done to his friend Mr. Ardsley. Then for
      three weeks he waited in dread suspense; until at last came a letter
      asking him to call and talk over his proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ardsley had been reading all Thyrsis' manuscripts, nor had he failed
      to note the triumph of "The Genius" abroad. It became at once apparent to
      Thyrsis that the new book had scored with him; it was a book that could
      hardly fail, he said&mdash;if only it were finished as it had been begun.
      Thyrsis made it clear that he intended to finish it; no man could gaze
      into his wild eyes, and hear him talk of it in breathless excitement,
      without realizing that he would die, if need be, rather than fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then the author went in to have a talk with the head of the firm. He
      spread out the treasures of his soul before this merchant, and the
      merchant sat and appraised them with a cold and critical eye. But Thyrsis,
      too, had learned something about trade by this time, and was watching the
      merchant; he made a desperate effort and summoned up the courage to state
      his demands&mdash;he wanted five hundred dollars advance, in installments,
      and he wanted fifteen per cent. royalty upon the book. To his wonder and
      amazement the merchant never turned a hair at this; and before they parted
      company, the incredible bargain had been made, and waited only the signing
      of the contracts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis went out from the building like a blind man who had suddenly
      received his sight. It seemed to him at that moment as if the last problem
      of his life had been solved. He sent off a telegram to Corydon to tell her
      of the victory, and a letter to Darrell, saying that he need send no more
      money&mdash;that the path was clear before his feet at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. This marked a new stage in the family's financial progress; and
      as usual it was signalized by a grand debauch in bill-paying. Also there
      was a real table-cover for Corydon, and a vase in which she might put
      spring-flowers; there were new dresses for the baby, and more important
      yet, a new addition to the house. This was to be a sort of lean-to at the
      rear, sixteen feet wide and eight feet deep, and divided into two
      apartments, one of which was to be the kitchen, and the other an extra
      bed-room. For they were going to keep a servant!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a new decision, to which they had come after much hesitation and
      discussion. It would be a frightful expense&mdash;including the cost of
      the extra food it would add over thirty dollars a month to their expenses;
      but it was the only way they could see the least hope of freedom, of any
      respite from household drudgery. It had been just a year now since they
      had set out upon their adventure in domesticity; and in that time Corydon
      figured that she had prepared two thousand meals for the baby. She had fed
      each one of them, spoonful by spoonful, into his mouth; and also she had
      washed two thousand spoons and dishes, and brushed off two thousand
      tables, and swept two thousand floors. And with every day of such drudgery
      the heights of music and literature seemed further away and more
      unattainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had seen something of servants in earlier days&mdash;he had
      memories of strange figures that during intervals of prosperity had
      flitted through his mother's home. There had been the frail, anaemic
      Swedish woman, who lived on tea and sugar, and afterwards had gone away
      and borne nine children, more frail and anaemic than herself; there had
      been the stout personage with the Irish brogue who had dropped the
      Christmas turkey out of the window and had not taken the trouble to go
      down after it; there had been the little old negress who had gone insane,
      and hurled the salt-box at his mother's head. But Thyrsis was hoping that
      they might avoid such troubles themselves; he had an idea that by watching
      at Castle Garden they might lay hold upon some young peasant-girl from
      Germany, who would be untouched by any of the corruptions of civilization.
      "A sort of Dorothea", he suggested to Corydon; and they agreed that they
      would search diligently and find such a "<i>treffliches Mädchen</i>", who
      would be trusting and affectionate, and would talk in German with the
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he spent several days hunting in strange places; and at last, in a
      dingy East-side employment-office, he came upon his <i>Schatz</i>. She was
      buxom and hearty, and fairly oozed good-nature at every pore; she had only
      been a week in the country, and was evidently naïve enough for any purpose
      whatever. She had no golden hair like Dorothea, but was swarthy&mdash;her
      German was complicated with a Hungarian accent, and with strange words
      that one had not come upon in Goethe and Freitag, and could not find in
      any dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis helped to gather up her various bags and bundles, and transported
      her out to the country. On the train he set to work to gain her
      confidence, and was forthwith entertained with the tale of all her
      heart-troubles. Back in the Hungarian village she had fallen in love with
      the son of a rich farmer, quite in Hermann and Dorothea fashion; but alas,
      in this case there had been no "<i>gute verstandige Mutter</i>" and no "<i>würdiger
      Pfarrer</i>"&mdash;instead there had been a hateful step-mother, and so
      the "<i>treffliches Mädchen</i>" had had to come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the little cottage at last; and then what a house-cleaning
      there was, what scrubbing of floors; and brushing out the cobwebs, and
      scouring of lamp-chimneys and scraping of kettles and sauce-pans! And what
      a relief it was for Corydon and Thyrsis to be able to go off for a walk
      together, without first having to carry the baby up to the farm-house! And
      how very poetical it was to come back and discover Dorothea with the baby
      in her lap, feeding it a supper of <i>butter-brod</i> with a slice of raw
      bacon!
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, alas, it came more and more to seem that the Dorothea
      idyl had not been meant to be taken as a work of realism. The "<i>treffliches</i>
      <i>Maedchen</i>" was perhaps <i>too</i> kind-hearted; her emotions were
      too voluminous for so small a house, her personality seemed to spread all
      over it. She would sing Hungarian love-ditties at her work; and somehow
      calling these "folksongs" did not help matters. Also, alas, she
      distributed about the house strange odors&mdash;of raw onions, boiled
      cabbage and perspiration. So, after three weeks, poor Dorothea had to be
      sent away&mdash;weeping copiously, and bewildered over this cruel
      misfortune. Corydon and Thyrsis went back again to washing their own
      dishes; being glad to pay the price for quietness and privacy, and vowing
      that they would never again try, to "keep a servant".
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. The spring-time had come; not so much the spring-time of poets
      and song-birds, as the spring-time of cold rains and wind. But still,
      little by little, the sun was getting the better of his enemies; and so
      with infinite caution they reduced the quantity of the baby's apparel, and
      got him and his "bongie cowtoos" out upon the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Thyrsis was over at his own place, wrestling with the book again.
      He had told himself that it would be easy, now that he was free from the
      money-terror. But alas, it was not easy, and nothing could make it easy.
      If he had more energy, it only meant that his vision reached farther, and
      set him a harder task. Never in his life did he write a book, the last
      quarter of which was not to him a nightmare labor. He would be staggering,
      half blind with exhaustion&mdash;like a runner at the end of a long race,
      with a rival close at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as usual, his stomach was beginning to weaken under the strain. He
      would come over sometimes, late in the afternoon, and lay his head in
      Corydon's lap, almost sobbing from weariness; and yet, after he had eaten
      a little and helped her with the hardest of her tasks, he would go away
      again, and work half through the night. There was nothing else he could do&mdash;there
      was no escaping from the thing; if he lay down to rest, or went for a
      walk, it would be only to think about it the whole time. He would feel
      that he was not getting enough exercise, and he would drive himself to
      some bodily tasks; but there was never anything that he could do, that he
      did not have the book eating away at his mind in the meantime. It was one
      of the calamities of his life that there was no way for him to play; all
      he could do was to take a stroll with Corydon, or to tramp over the
      country by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished the book in May; and he knew that it was good. He sent it off
      to Mr. Ardsley, and Mr. Ardsley, too, declared himself satisfied, and sent
      the balance of the money. So Thyrsis sank back to get his breath, and to
      put back some flesh upon his skeleton. He was wont to say when he was
      writing, one could measure his progress upon a scales; every five thousand
      words he finished cost him a Shylock's price.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summer was, upon the whole, the happiest time they had yet known. The
      book was scheduled to appear early in September; and they had money enough
      to last them meantime, with careful economy. Their little home was
      beautiful; they planted some sweet peas and roses, and Thyrsis even began
      to dig at a vegetable-garden. Also, it was strawberry-time, and
      cherry-time was near; nor did they overlook the fact that they lived in
      close proximity to a peach-orchard. These, perhaps, were prosaic
      considerations, and not of the sort which Thyrsis had been accustomed to
      associate with spring-time. But this he hardly realized&mdash;so rapidly
      was the discipline of domesticity bringing his haughty spirit to terms!
    </p>
    <p>
      He built a rustic seat in the woods, where they might sit and read; he
      built a table beside the house, where the dishes might be washed under the
      blue sky; and he perfected an elaborate set of ditches and dykes, so that
      the rain-storms would not sweep away their milk and butter in the stream.
      He talked of building a pen for chickens&mdash;and might have done so,
      only he discovered that the perverse creatures would not lay except at the
      time when eggs were cheap and one did not care so much about them. He even
      figured on the cost of a cow, and the possibility of learning to milk it;
      and was so much enthralled by these bucolic occupations that he wrote a
      magazine-article to acquaint his struggling brother and sister poets with
      the fact that they, too, might escape to the country and live in a
      home-made house!
    </p>
    <p>
      With the article there went a picture of the house, and also one of the
      baby, who had been waxing enormous, and now constituted a fine
      advertisement. The winter had seemed to agree with him, and the summer
      agreed with him even better. Thyrsis would smile now and then, thinking of
      his ideas of martyrdom; it was made evident that one member of the family
      was not minded for anything of the sort. The parents might become so much
      absorbed in their soul-problems that they forgot the dinner-hour; but one
      could have set his watch by the appetite of the baby. Nature had provided
      him, among other protections, with a truly phenomenal pair of lungs; and
      whenever life took a course that was not satisfactory to him, he would
      roar his face to a terrifying purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one overwhelming and incessant outcry for adventure. He would
      toddle all day about the place, getting his "mungies" into all sorts of
      messes. He was hard to fit into so small a place, and there were times
      when his parents were tempted to wish that some phenomenon a trifle less
      portentous had fallen to their lot. But for the most part he was a great
      hope&mdash;a sort of visible atonement for their sufferings. He at least
      was an achievement; he was something they had done. And he could not be
      undone, nor doubted&mdash;he put all skepticism to flight. In his vicinity
      there was no room for pessimistic philosophies, for <i>Weltschmerz</i> or
      <i>Karma</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis would sit now and then and watch him at play, and think thoughts
      that went deep into the meaning of things. Here was, in its very living
      presence, that blind will-to-be which had seized them and flung them
      together. And it seemed to Thyrsis that somehow Nature, with her strange
      secret chemistry, had reproduced all the elements they had brought to that
      union. This child was immense, volcanic, as their impulse had been; he was
      intense, highly-strung, and exacting&mdash;and these qualities too they
      had furnished. Curious also it was to observe how Nature, having
      accomplished her purpose, now flung aside her concealments and devices.
      From now on they existed to minister to this new life-phenomenon, to keep
      it happy and prosperous and she cared not how plain this might become to
      them&mdash;she feared not to taunt and humiliate them. And they accepted
      her sentence meekly, they no longer tried to oppose her. Her will was
      become an axiom which they never disputed, which they never even
      discussed. No matter what might happen to them in future, the Child must
      go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. Thyrsis utilized this summer of leisure to begin a course of
      reading in Socialism&mdash;a subject which had been stretching out its
      arms to him ever since he had made the acquaintance of Henry Darrell. He
      had held away from it on purpose, not wishing to complicate his mind with
      too many problems. But now he had finished with history, and was free to
      come back to the world of the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the pamphlets that Darrell had given him, and there was Paret's
      magazine. Strange to say, the latter's reckless jesting with the
      philanthropists and reformers no longer offended Thyrsis&mdash;he had been
      travelling fast along the road of disillusionment. Also, there was a
      Socialist paper in New York&mdash;"The Worker"; and more important still,
      there was the "Appeal to Reason". Thyrsis came upon a chance reference to
      this paper, which was published in a little town in Kansas, and he was
      astonished to learn that it claimed a circulation of two hundred thousand
      copies a week. He became a subscriber, and after that the process of his
      "conversion" was rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Appeal was an "agitation-paper". Its business was to show that side of
      the capitalist process which other publications tried to conceal, or at
      any rate to gild and dress up and make presentable. Each week came four
      closely-printed newspaper-pages, picturing horrors in mills and mines,
      telling of oppression and injustice, of unemployment and misery, accident,
      disease and death. There would be accounts of political corruption&mdash;of
      the buying of legislatures and courts, of the rule of "machines" of graft
      in city and state and nation. There would be tales of the manners and
      morals of the idle rich, set against others of the sufferings of the poor.
      And week by week, as he read and pondered, Thyrsis began to realize the
      absurd inadequacy of the placid statement which he had made to his first
      Socialist acquaintance&mdash;that the solution of such problems was to be
      left to "evolution". It became only too clear to him that here was another
      war&mdash;the class-war; and that it was being fought by the masters with
      every weapon that cunning and greed could lay hands upon or contrive. In
      that struggle Thyrsis saw clearly that his place was in the ranks of the
      disinherited and dispossessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not a difficult decision; for in the first place he was one of
      the disinherited and dispossessed himself; and in the next place, even
      before the "economic screw" had penetrated his consciousness, he had been
      a rebel in his sympathies and tastes. Jesus, Isaiah, Milton, Shelley&mdash;such
      men as these had been the friends of his soul; and he had sought in vain
      for their spirit in modern society&mdash;he had thought that it was dead,
      and that he, and a few other lonely dreamers in garrets, were the only
      ones who knew or cared about it. But now he came upon the amazing
      discovery that this spirit, driven from legislative-halls and courts of
      justice, from churches and schools and editorial sanctums, had flamed into
      life in the hearts of the working class, and was represented in a
      political party which numbered some thirty millions of adherents and cast
      some seven million votes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning nearly a century ago, these workmgmen had taken the spirit of
      Jesus and Isaiah and Milton and Shelley, and had worked out a scientific
      basis for it, and a method whereby it could be made to count in the world
      of affairs. They had analyzed all the evils of modern society&mdash;poverty
      and luxury, social and political corruption, prostitution, crime and war;
      they had not only discovered the causes of them, but had laid down with
      mathematical precision the remedies, and had gone on to carry the remedies
      into effect. In every civilized land upon the globe they were at work as a
      political party of protest; they were holding conventions and adopting
      programs; they had an enormous literature, they were publishing newspapers
      and magazines, many of them having circulations of hundreds of thousands
      of copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest thing of all was this. Thyrsis was an educated man&mdash;or
      was supposed to be. He had spent five years in schools, and nine years in
      colleges and universities; he had given the scholars of the world full
      opportunity to guide him to whatever was of importance. Also, he had been
      an omnivorous reader upon his own impulse; and here he was, at the end of
      it all&mdash;practically ignorant that this enormous movement existed!
    </p>
    <p>
      In economic classes in college there had, of course, been some mention of
      Socialism; but this had been of the utopian variety, the dreams of Plato
      and St. Simon and Fourier. There had been some account of the innumerable
      communities which had sprung up in America&mdash;with careful explanation,
      however, that they had all proven failures. Also one heard vaguely of Marx
      and Lassalle, two violent men, whose ideas were still popular among the
      ignorant masses of Europe, but could be of no concern to the fortunate
      inhabitants of a free Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after this, to come upon some piece of writing&mdash;such as,
      for instance, the "Communist Manifesto"! To read this mile-stone in the
      progress of civilization, this marvellous exposition of the development of
      human societies, and of the forces which drive and control them; and to
      realize that two lonely students, who had cast in their lot with the
      exploited toilers, had been able to predict the whole course of political
      and industrial evolution for sixty years, and to foresee and expound with
      precision the ultimate outcome of the whole process&mdash;matters of which
      the orthodox economists were still as ignorant as babes unborn!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or to discover the writings of such a man as Karl Kautsky, the
      intellectual leader of the modern movement in Germany; such books as "The
      Social Revolution", and "The Road to Power"&mdash;in which one seemed to
      see a giant of the mind, standing in a death-duel with those forces of
      night and destruction that still made of the fair earth a hell! With what
      accuracy he was able to measure the strength of these powers of evil, to
      anticipate their every move, to plan the exact parry with which to meet
      them! To Thyrsis he seemed like some general commanding an army in battle,
      with the hopes of future ages hanging upon his skill. But this was a
      general who fought, not with sword and fire, but with ideas; a conqueror
      in the cause of "right reason and the will of God". He wrote simply, as a
      scientist; and yet one could feel the passion behind the quiet words&mdash;the
      hourly shock of the incessant conflict, the grim persistence which pressed
      on in the face of obloquy and persecution, the courage which had been
      tested through generations of anguish and toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis' mind rushed through these things like prairie-fire; and all the
      time that he read, his wonder grew upon him. How <i>could</i> he have been
      kept ignorant of them? He was quick to pounce upon the essential fact,
      that this was no accident; it was something that must have been planned
      and brought about deliberately. He had thought that he was being educated,
      when in reality he was being held back and fenced off from truth. It was a
      world-wide conspiracy&mdash;it was that very class-war which the
      established order was waging upon these men and their ideas!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. It was not difficult for any one to understand the ideas, if he
      really wished to. They began with the fact of "surplus value". One man
      employed another man for the sake of the wealth he could be made to
      produce, over what he was paid as wages. That seemed obvious enough; and
      yet, what consequences came from following it up! Throughout human history
      men had been setting other men to work; whether they were called slaves,
      or serfs, or laborers, or servants, the motive-power which had set them to
      work had been the desire for "surplus value". And as the process went on,
      those who appropriated the profits combined for mutual protection; and so
      out of the study of "surplus value" came the discovery of the
      "class-struggle". Human history was the tale of the arising of some
      dominating class, and of the struggle of some subject class for a larger
      share of what it produced. Human governments were devices by which the
      master-class preserved its power; and whatever may have been the original
      purposes of arts and religions, in the end they had always been seized by
      the master-class, and used as aids in the same struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One came to the culmination of the process in modern capitalist society.
      Here was a class entrenched in power, owning the sources of wealth, the
      huge machines whereby it was produced, and the railroads whereby it was
      distributed, and above all, the financial resources upon which the other
      processes depended. One saw this class holding itself in power by means of
      the policeman's club and the militiaman's rifle, by machine-gun and
      battle-ship; one saw that, whether by bribery or by outright force, it had
      seized all the powers of government, of legislatures and executives and
      courts. One saw that in the same way it had seized upon the sources of
      ideas; it controlled the newspapers and the churches and the colleges,
      that it might shape the thoughts of men and keep them content. It set up
      in places of authority men whose views were agreeable to it&mdash;who
      believed in the beneficence of its rule and the permanence of its system;
      who would pour out ridicule and contempt upon those who suggested that any
      other system might be conceivable. And so the class-war was waged, not
      merely in the world of industry and politics, but also, in the
      intellectual world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And step by step, as the processes of capitalism culminated, this war
      increased in bitterness and intensity. For, of course, as capital heaped
      up and its control became concentrated, the ratio of exploitation
      increased. The great mass of labor was unorganized and helpless; whereas
      the masters had combined and fixed their prices; and so day by day the
      cost of living increased, and misery and discontent increased with it. As
      capital expanded, and new machines of production were added, there were
      more and more goods to sell, and more and more difficulty in finding
      markets; and so came overproduction and unemployment, panics and crises;
      so came wars for foreign markets&mdash;with new opportunities of plunder
      for the exploiters and new hardships and new taxes for the producers. And
      so was fulfilled the prophecy of Marx and Engels; under the pressure of
      bitter necessity the proletariat was organizing and disciplining itself,
      training its own leaders and thinkers forming itself into a world-wide
      political party, whose destiny it was to conquer the powers of government
      in every land, and use them to turn out the exploiters, and to put an end
      to the rule of privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change was what the Socialists meant by the "revolution"&mdash;the
      transfer of the ownership of the means of production; and it was about
      that issue that the class-war was waged. Nothing else but that counted;
      without that all reform was futility, and all benevolence was mockery, and
      all knowledge was ignorance. So long as the means of producing necessities
      were owned by a few, and used for the advantage of a few, just so long
      must there be want in the midst of plenty, and darkness over all the
      earth. Whatever evil one went out into the world to combat, he came to
      realize that he could do nothing against it, because it was bound up with
      the capitalist system, was in fact itself that system. If little children
      were shut up in sweat-shops, if women were sold into brothels, it was not
      for any fault of theirs, it was not the work of any devil&mdash;it was
      simply because of the "surplus value". they represented. If weaker nations
      were conquered and "civilized", that, too, was for "surplus value". And
      these epidemics of "graft" that broke out upon the body politic&mdash;they
      were not accidental or sporadic things, and they were not to be remedied
      by putting any number of men in jail; they were to be understood as the
      system whereby an industrial oligarchy had rendered impotent a political
      democracy, and had fenced it out from the fields of privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so also was it with the dullness and sterility that prevailed in the
      intellectual world. The master-class did not want ideas&mdash;it only
      wanted to be let alone; and so it put in the seats of authority men who
      were blind to the blazing beacon-fires of the future. It would be no
      exaggeration to say that the intellectual and cultural system of the
      civilized world was conducted, whether deliberately or instinctively, for
      the purpose of keeping the truth about exploitation from becoming clear to
      the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master-class owned the newspapers and ran them. It had built and
      endowed the churches, and taught the clergy to feed out of its hand. In
      the same way it had founded the colleges, and named the trustees, who in
      turn named the presidents and professors. The ordinary mortal took it for
      granted that because venerable bishops and dignified editors and learned
      college-professors were all in agreement as to a certain truth, there must
      be some inherent probability in that truth; and never once perceived how
      the cards were stacked and the dice loaded&mdash;how those clergymen and
      editors and professors had all been selected because they believed that
      truth to be true, and believed the contrary falsehood to be false!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how smoothly and automatically the system worked! How these
      dignitaries stood together, and held up each other's hands, maintaining
      the august tradition, the atmosphere of authority and power! The bishops
      praising the editors, and the editors praising the professors, and the
      professors praising the bishops! And when the circle was completed, what
      <i>lése</i> <i>majesté</i> it seemed for an ordinary mortal to oppose
      their conclusions!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishops, one perceived, were "orthodox"&mdash;that is to say they were
      concerned with barren formulas; and they were "spiritual"&mdash;they were
      concerned with imaginary future states of bliss. The editors were "safe"
      and "conservative"&mdash;that is to say, their souls were dead and their
      eyes were sealed and their god was property. And when it came to the
      selecting of the college professors, of the men who were to guide and
      instruct the forthcoming generations&mdash;what precautions would be taken
      then! What consultations and investigations, what testimonials and
      interviews and examinations! For after all, in these new days, it could be
      no easy matter to find men whose minds were sterilized, who could face
      without blenching all the horrors of the capitalist regime! Who could see
      courts and congresses bought and sold; who could see children ground up in
      mills and factories, and women driven by the lash of want to sell their
      bodies; who could see the surplus of the world's wealth squandered in riot
      and debauchery, and the nations armed and drilled and sent out to
      slaughter each other in the quest for more. Who could know that all these
      things existed, and yet remain in their cloistered halls and pursue the
      placid ways of scholarship; who could teach history which regarded them as
      inevitable; who could care for literature that had been made for the
      amusement of slave-drivers, and art which existed for the sake of art, and
      not for the sake of humanity; who could know everything that was useless,
      and teach everything that was uninteresting, and could be dead at once to
      the warnings of the past, and to all that was vital and important in the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. Not since he had discovered the master-key of Evolution had
      Thyrsis come upon any set of ideas that meant so much to him. It was not
      that these were new to him&mdash;they were the stuff out of which his
      whole life had been made; but here they were ordered and systematized&mdash;he
      had a handle by which to take hold of them. The name of this handle was
      "the economic interpretation of history". And its import was that ideas
      did not come by hazard, or out of the air, but were products of social
      conditions; and that when one knew by what method the wealth of any
      community was produced, and by what class its "surplus value" was
      appropriated&mdash;then and then only could one understand the arts and
      customs, the sciences and religions, which that community would evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of this great principle Thyrsis had to revise all his
      previous knowledge; he had to cast out tons of rubbish from the chambers
      of his mind, and start his thinking life all over again. Just as, in early
      days, he had exchanged miracles and folk-tales for facts of natural
      science; so now he saw political institutions and social codes, literary
      and artistic canons, and ethical and philosophical systems, no longer as
      things valid and excellent, having relationship to truth&mdash;but simply
      as intrenchments and fortifications in the class-war, as devices which
      some men had used to deceive and plunder some other men. What a light it
      threw upon philosophy, for instance, to perceive it, not as a search for
      truth, but as a search for justification upon the part of ruling classes,
      and for a basis of attack upon the part of subject-classes!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for instance, on the one side one found Rousseau, and on the other
      Herbert Spencer. Thyrsis had read Spencer, and had cordially disliked him
      for his dogmatism and his callousness; but now he read Kropotkin's "Mutual
      Aid as a Factor in Evolution", and came to a realization of how the whole
      science of biology had been distorted to suit the convenience of the
      British ruling-classes. <i>Laissez-faire</i> and the Manchester school had
      taught him that "each for himself and the devil take the hindmost" was the
      universal law of life; and he had accepted it, because there seemed
      nothing else that he could do. But now, in a sudden flash, he came to see
      that the law of life was exactly the opposite; everywhere throughout
      nature that which survived was not ruthless egotism, but co-operative
      intelligence. The solitary and predatory animals were now almost entirely
      extinct; and even before the advent of man with his social brain, it had
      been the herbivorous and gregarious animals which had become most
      numerous. When it came to man, was it not perfectly obvious that the races
      which had made civilization were those which had developed the nobler
      virtues, such as honor and loyalty and patriotism? And now it was proposed
      to trample them into the mire of "business"; to abandon the race to a
      glorified debauch of greed! And this travesty of science was taught in ten
      thousand schools and colleges throughout America&mdash;and all because
      certain British gentlemen had wished to work their cotton-operatives
      fourteen hours a day, and certain others had wished to keep land which
      their ancestors had seized in the days of William the Conqueror! Shortly
      after this Thyrsis came upon Edmond Kelly's great work, "Government, or
      Human Evolution"; and so he realized that Herbert Spencer's social
      philosophy had at last been cleared out of the pathway of humanity. And
      this was a great relief to him&mdash;it was one more back-breaking task
      that he did not have to contemplate!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. Then one of his Socialist friends sent him Thorstein Veblen's
      "Theory of the Leisure Class"; a book which he read in a continuous
      ebullition of glee. Truly it was a delicious thing to find a man who could
      employ the lingo of the ultra-sophisticated sociologist, and use it in a
      demonstration of the most revolutionary propositions. The drollery of this
      was all the more enjoyable because Thyrsis could never be sure that the
      author himself intended it&mdash;whether his sesquipedalian irony might
      not be a pure product of nature, untouched by any human art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veblen's book might have been called a study of the ultimate destiny of
      "surplus value"; an economic interpretation of the social arts and graces,
      of "fashions" and "fads". Where men competed for the fruit of each other's
      labor, the possession of wealth was the sign of excellence. This
      excellence men wished to demonstrate to others; and step by step, as the
      methods of production and exploitation changed, one might trace the change
      in the methods of this demonstration. The savage chief began with
      nose-rings and anklets, and the trophies of his fights; then, as he grew
      richer, he would employ courtiers and concubines, and shine by vicarious
      splendor. He would give banquets and build palaces&mdash;the end being
      always "the conspicuous consumption of goods".
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on came those stages when he no longer had to gain his wealth by
      physical prowess; when cunning took the place of force, and he ruled by
      laws and religions and moral codes, and handed down his power through long
      lines of descendants. Then ostentation became a highly specialized and
      conventionalized thing&mdash;its criterion changing gradually to
      "conspicuous waste of time". Those characteristics were cultivated which
      served to advertise to the world that their possessor had never had to
      earn wealth, nor to do anything for himself; the aristocrat became a
      special type of being, with small feet and hands and a feeble body, with
      special ways of walking and talking, of dressing and eating and playing.
      He developed a separate religion, a separate language, separate
      literatures and arts, separate vices and virtues. And fantastic and
      preposterous as some of these might seem, they were real things, they were
      the means whereby the leisure-class individual took part in the
      competition of his own world, and secured his own prestige and the
      survival of his line. Some philosopher had said that virtue is a product
      like vinegar; and it was a pleasant thing to discover that French heels
      and "picture-hats" and course-dinners were products also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis would read passages of this book aloud to Corydon, and they would
      chuckle over it together; but the reading of it did not bring Corydon the
      same unalloyed delight. In the leisure-class <i>régime</i>, the woman is a
      cherished possession&mdash;for it is through her that the ability to waste
      both time and goods can best be shown. So came Veblen's grim and ironic
      exposition of the leisure-class woman, an exposition which Corydon found
      almost too painful to be read. For Corydon's ancestors, as far back as
      documents could trace, had been members of that class. They had left her
      the frail and beautiful body, conspicuously useless and dependent; they
      had left her all the leisure-class impulses and cravings, all the
      leisure-class impotences and futilities to contend with. They had taught
      her nothing about cooking, nothing about sewing, nothing about babies,
      nothing about money; they had taught her only the leisure-class dream of
      "love in a cottage"&mdash;and she had run away with a poor poet to try it
      out!
    </p>
    <p>
      The depth of these instincts in Corydon was amusingly illustrated by the
      fact that she always woke up dull and discouraged, and was seldom really
      herself until afternoon; and that along about ten o'clock at night, when
      for the sake of her health she should have been going to bed, she would be
      laughing, talking, singing, ablaze with interest and excitement. Thyrsis
      would point this out to her, and please himself by picturing the role
      which she should have been filling&mdash;wearing an empire gown and a rope
      or two of rubies, and presiding in an opera-box or a <i>salon</i>. Corydon
      would repudiate all this with indignation; but all the same she never
      escaped from the phrases of Veblen&mdash;she remained his "leisure-class
      wife" from that day forth. Not so very long afterwards they came upon
      Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler"; and Thyrsis shuddered to observe that of all the
      heroines in the world's literature, that was the one which most appealed
      to her. Nor did he fail to observe the working of the thing in himself;
      the subtle and deeply-buried instinct which made him prefer to be wretched
      with a "leisure-class wife" rather than to be contented with a plebeian
      one!

      BOOK XIV. THE PRICE OF RANSOM
    </h2>

      <i>The faint grey of dawn was stealing across the lake; and still the
      spell was upon them. </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here
        Sole in these fields! yet will I not despair."
</pre>
    <p>
      So she whispered; and he answered her&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,
    Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep.
            Some life of men unblest

        He went; his piping took a troubled sound
        Of storms that rage outside our happy ground."
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. In the course of that summer there befell Corydon an adventure;
      Thyrsis had gone off one day for a walk, and when he came back she told
      him about it&mdash;how a young lady had stopped at the house to ask for a
      drink of water, and had sat upon the piazza to rest, and had talked with
      her. Now Corydon was in a state of excitement over a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Thyrsis met a stranger, it was necessary for him to go through
      elaborate intellectual processes, to find the person out by an exchange of
      ideas. And if by any chance the person was insincere, and used ideas as a
      blind and a cover, then Thyrsis might never find him out at all. In other
      words, he took people at the face-value of their cultural equipment; and
      only after long and tragic blunderings could he by any chance get deeper.
      But with his wife it happened quite otherwise; this case was the first
      which he witnessed, but the same thing happened many times afterwards.
      With her there would be a strange flash of recognition; it was a sort of
      intuition, perhaps a psychic thing&mdash;who could tell? By some unknown
      process in soul-chemistry, she would divine things about a person that he
      might have been a life-time in finding out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be a burst of passionate interest, or on the other hand, of
      repugnance and fear. And long years of practice taught Thyrsis that this
      instinct of hers was never to be disregarded. Not once in all her life did
      he know her to give her affection to a base person; and if ever he
      disregarded her antipathies, he did it to his cost. Once they were sitting
      in a restaurant, and a man was brought up to be introduced by a friend; he
      was a person of not unpleasant aspect, courteous and apparently a
      gentleman, and yet Corydon flushed, and could scarcely keep her seat at
      the table, and would not give the man her hand. Years after Thyrsis came
      upon the discovery about this man, that he made a practice of unnatural
      vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came home now to find Corydon flushed with excitement. "She has such a
      beautiful soul!" she exclaimed. "I never met anyone like her. And we just
      took to each other; she told me all about herself, and we are going to be
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is she?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's visiting Mr. Harding, the clergyman at Bellevue," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellevue was a town in the valley, on the other side from the university;
      it had a Presbyterian church, whose young pastor Thyrsis had met once or
      twice in his tramps about the country. This Miss Gordon, it seemed, was
      the niece of an elderly relative, his housekeeper; she was studying
      trained nursing, and afterwards intended to go out as a missionary to
      Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's so anxious to meet you," Corydon went on. "She's coming up to see
      me to-morrow, and she's going to bring Mr. Harding. You won't mind, will
      you, Thyrsis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I can stand it if he can," said Thyrsis, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't say anything to hurt their feelings," said Corydon, quickly.
      "She's terribly orthodox, you know; and she takes it so seriously. I was
      surprised&mdash;I had never thought that I could stand anybody like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis merely grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess ideas don't matter so much after all," said Corydon. "It's a deep
      nature that I care about. But just fancy&mdash;she was pained because the
      baby hadn't been baptized!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have hid the dreadful truth," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't hide things from her," laughed Corydon, "But she says I can
      make a Socialist out of her, and she'll make a Christian out of me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply was, "Wait until she discovers the sensuous temperament!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corydon answered that Delia Gordon had a sensuous temperament also.
      "She seemed to me like a Joan of Arc. Just think of her going away from
      all her family, to a station on the Congo River! She told me all about it&mdash;how
      wretched the people are, and what the women suffer. She woke up in the
      middle of the night, and a voice told her to go&mdash;told her the name of
      the place. And she'd never heard it before, and hadn't had the least idea
      of going away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was unmoved by this miracle. "I suppose," he said, "you'll be
      hearing voices yourself, and going with her. Tell me, is she pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't call her pretty," said Corydon, after a little thought.
      "She's just&mdash;just dear. Oh, Thyrsis, I simply fell in love with her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly chose an odd kind of an affinity," he said. "A Presbyterian
      missionary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's worse than that," confessed Corydon. "She's a Seventh-day
      Adventist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God! And what may that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she keeps Saturday instead of Sunday. She calls it the Sabbath. And
      she thinks that 'evolution' is wicked, and she believes in some kind of a
      hell! She's not just sure what kind, apparently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You watch out," said he, "or the first thing you know she'll be baptizing
      the baby behind your back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that do any good?" asked Corydon, guilelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he answered, "It would, from her point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which she replied, "Well, if we didn't know it and the baby didn't, I
      guess it wouldn't do any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it might save him from some kind of a hell!" added Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Miss Gordon came the next morning, Mr. Harding with her; and the
      four sat out under the trees and talked. She was a girl some three years
      older than Corydon, but much more mature; she was short, but athletic in
      build, and with a bright personality. Thyrsis could see at once those fine
      qualities of idealism and fervor which had attracted Corydon; and to his
      surprise he found that, in addition to her religious virtues, the Lord had
      generously added a sense of humor. So Delia Gordon was really a person
      with whom one could have a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord had not been quite so generous with the Rev. Mr. Harding,
      apparently. Mr. Harding was about thirty years of age, tall and
      finely-built, with a slight, fair moustache, and a rather girlish
      complexion. He was evidently of a sentimental inclination, very sensitive,
      and a lovable person; but the sense of humor Thyrsis judged was
      underdeveloped. He was inclined towards social-reform, and had a club for
      working-boys in his town, of which he was very proud; he asked Thyrsis to
      come and give a literary talk to these boys, and Thyrsis replied that his
      views of things were hardly orthodox. When the clergyman asked for
      elucidation, Thyrsis added, with a smile, "I don't believe that Jonah ever
      swallowed the whale". Whereupon Mr. Harding proceeded with all gravity to
      correct his misapprehension of this legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fires of friendship, thus suddenly lighted between the two girls,
      continued to burn. Delia Gordon came nearly every day to see Corydon, and
      once or twice Corydon went down to the town and had lunch with her. They
      told each other all the innermost secrets of their hearts, and in the
      evening Corydon would retail these to Thyrsis, who was thus put in the way
      to acquire that knowledge of human nature so essential to a novelist.
      Delia had never been in love, it seemed&mdash;her only passion was for
      savage tribes along the Congo; but Mr. Harding had been involved in a
      heart-tragedy some time ago, and was supposed to be still inconsolable.
      Incredible as it might seem, he was apparently not in love with Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, needless to say, the pair did not fail to thresh out problems of
      theology. Delia made in due course the dreadful discovery of the sensuous
      temperament; and also she probed to the depths the frightful ocean of
      unorthodoxy that was hid beneath the placid surface of Corydon. But
      strange to say, this did not repel her, nor make any difference in their
      friendship. Thyrsis took that for the sign of a liberal attitude, but
      Corydon corrected him with a shrewd observation&mdash;"She's so sure of
      her own truth she can't believe in the reality of any other. She <i>knows</i>
      I'll come to Jesus with her some day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful thing to Thyrsis to see his wife's happiness just then;
      she was like a flower which has been wilting, and suddenly receives a
      generous shower of rain. It was just what he had prayed for; having seen
      all along that her wretchedness was owing to her being shut up alone with
      him. So now he did his best to repress his own opinions, and to let the
      two friends work out their problem undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Thyrsis," Corydon exclaimed to him, one night, "if I could only have
      her with me, I'd be happy always!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why don't you get her to stay with you?" asked Thyrsis, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but she wouldn't think of it," said Corydon. "She doesn't really care
      about anything in the world but her Congo savages!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might try," said he. "When does she complete her course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until the end of the year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can do a lot of arguing in that time. And when the book is out,
      we'll have money enough, so that we can offer to pay her. She might become
      a sort of 'mother's helper.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. So Thyrsis began a struggle with Jesus and the Congo savages, for
      the possession of Delia's soul. He set to work to interest her in his
      work; he gave her his first novel, which contained no theology at all; and
      also "The Hearer of Truth"&mdash;the social radicalism of which he was
      pleased to see did not alarm her. And then he gave her the war-novel, and
      saw with joy how she was thrilled over that. He laid himself out to make
      his purpose and his vision clear to her; and then, one afternoon, when
      Corydon had a headache and was taking a nap, he led her off to a quiet
      place in the woods, and set before her all the bitter tragedy of their
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pictured the work he had to do, and the loneliness to which this
      consigned Corydon; he told her of the horrors they had so far endured, and
      what effect these had had upon his wife. He showed her what her power was&mdash;how
      she could make life possible for both of them. For she had that magic key
      which Thyrsis himself did not possess, she could unlock the
      treasure-chambers of Corydon's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, Thyrsis soon perceived that his efforts had been in vain. Delia
      was stirred by his eloquence, but the only effect was to move her to an
      equally eloquent account of the sufferings of the natives of the Congo
      basin. It was important that he should get his books written; but how much
      more important it was that some help should be carried to these unhappy
      wretches! They never saw any books, they were altogether beyond his reach;
      and who was to take the light to them? She told him harrowing tales of
      sick women, beaten and tortured and burned with fire to drive the devils
      out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis met this by attempting to broaden the girl's social consciousness.
      He showed her how the waves of intelligence, beginning at the top, spread
      to the lowest strata of society&mdash;changing the character of all human
      activities, and affecting the humblest life. He showed her the capitalist
      system, and explained how it worked; how it reached to the savage in the
      remotest corner of the earth, and seized him and made him over according
      to its will. It was true, for instance&mdash;and not in any poetic sense,
      but literally and demonstrably true&mdash;that the fate of the Congo
      native was determined in Wall Street, and in the financial centres of
      London and Paris and Brussels and Berlin. The essential thing about the
      natives was that they represented rubber and ivory. And Delia might go
      there, and try to teach them and help them, but she would find that there
      were forces engaged in beating them down and destroying them&mdash;forces
      in comparison with which she was as helpless as a child. It was true of
      the Congo blacks, as it was true of the people of the slums, of the
      proletariat of the whole earth, that there was no way to help them save to
      overthrow the system which made of them, not human beings, but
      commodities, to be purchased and passed through the profit-mill, and then
      flung into the scrap-heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thyrsis found to his pain that it was impossible to make these
      considerations of any real import to Delia. She understood them, she
      assented to them; but that did not make them count. Her impulses came from
      another part of her being. Her savages were naked and hungry and ignorant
      and miserable; and they needed to be fed and clothed, and more important
      yet, to be baptized and saved. She was all the more impelled to her task
      by the fact that all the forces of civilization were arrayed against her.
      The fires of martyrdom were blazing in her soul. She meant to throw
      herself over a precipice&mdash;and the higher the precipice, and the more
      jagged the rocks beneath, the greater was the thrill which the prospect
      brought her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. They went back to the house; as Delia had arranged to spend the
      night with them, and as Corydon's headache was better, the controversy was
      continued far into the evening. Thyrsis took no part in it, he listened
      while Corydon pleaded for herself, and pictured her loneliness and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia put her arms about her. "Don't you see, dear," she argued&mdash;"all
      that is because you are without a faith! You cast out Jesus, and deny him;
      and so how can <i>I</i> help you? If you believed what I do, you would not
      be lonely, even if you were in the heart of Africa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can I believe what isn't <i>true?</i>" cried Corydon; and so the
      skeletons of theology came forth and rattled their bones once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of hours must have passed, while Thyrsis said nothing, but
      listened to Delia and watched her, probing deeply into the agonies and
      futilities of life. He had given up all hope of persuading her to stay
      with them; he thought only of the tragedy, that this noble spirit should
      be tangled up and blundering about in the mazes of a grotesque dogma. And
      the time came when he could endure it no more; something rose up within
      him, something tremendous and terrible, and he laid hold of Delia Gordon's
      soul to wrestle with it, as never before had he wrestled with any human
      soul except Corydon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of the matter was that Thyrsis loved the religious people; it
      was among them that he had been brought up, and their ways were his ways.
      This was a fact that came to him rarely now, for he was hard-driven and
      bitter; but it was true that when he sneered at the church and taunted it,
      he was like a parent who whips a child he loves. Perhaps Paret had spoken
      truly in one of his cruel jests&mdash;that when a man has been brought up
      religious, he can never really get over it, he can never really be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now Thyrsis spoke to Delia as one who was himself of the faith of
      Jesus; he cried out to her that what she wanted was what he wanted, that
      all her attitudes and ways of working were his. And here were monstrous
      evils alive upon the earth&mdash;here were all the forces of hell
      unleashed, and ranging like savage beasts destroying the lives of men and
      women! And those who truly cared, those who had the conscience and the
      faith of the world in their keeping&mdash;they were wasting their time in
      disputations about barren formulas, questions which had no relationship to
      human life! Questions of the meaning of old Hebrew texts that had often no
      meaning at all, and of folk-tales and fairy-stories out of the nursery of
      the race&mdash;the problem of whether Jonah had swallowed the whale, or
      the whale had swallowed Jonah&mdash;the problem of whether it was on
      Friday or Saturday that the Lord had finished the earth. Because of such
      things as this, they drove all thinking men from their ranks, they
      degraded and made ridiculous the very name of faith! As he went on, the
      agony of this swept over Thyrsis&mdash;until it seemed to him as if he had
      the whole Christian Church before him, and was pleading with it in the
      voice of Jesus. Here was a new crucifixion&mdash;a crucifixion of
      civilization! Thyrsis cried out in the words, "Oh ye of little faith!"
      Truly, was it not the supreme act of infidelity, to make the spirit of
      religion, which was one with the impulse of all life&mdash;the force that
      made the flower bloom and oak-tree tower and the infant cry for its food&mdash;to
      make it dependent upon Hebrew texts and Assyrian folk-tales! Delia
      preached to him about "faith"; but what was her faith in comparison with
      his, which was a faith in all life&mdash;which trusted the soul of man,
      and reason as part of the soul of man, a thing which God had put in man to
      be used, and not to be feared and outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Delia. She would not admit that her faith depended upon texts
      and legends; it was a faith in the living God. She was not afraid of
      reason&mdash;she did not outrage it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you do, you do!" cried Thyrsis. "Your whole attitude is an outrage to
      it! You never speak of 'science' except as an evil thing. You told Corydon
      that 'evolution' was wicked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how evolution can help my faith"&mdash;began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it!" cried Thyrsis again. "That is exactly what I mean! You
      do not pay homage to truth, you do not seek it for its own sake! You
      require that it should fit into certain formulas that you have set up&mdash;in
      other words that it should not interfere with your texts and your legends!
      And what is the result of that&mdash;you have paralyzed all your
      activities, you have condemned your intellectual life to sterility! For we
      live in an age of science, we cannot solve our problems except by means of
      it; the forces of evil are using it, and you are not using it, and so you
      are like a child in their hands! Not one of the social wrongs but could be
      put an end to&mdash;child-labor, poverty and disease, prostitution and
      drunkenness, crime and war! But you don't know how, and you can't find out
      how&mdash;simply because you have thrown away the sharp tools of the
      intellect, and filled your mind with formulas that mean nothing! How can
      you understand modern problems, when you know nothing about economics? You
      have rejected 'evolution'&mdash;so how can you comprehend the evolution of
      society? How can you know that civilization at this hour is going down
      into the abyss&mdash;dragging you and your churches and your Congo savages
      with it? I who do understand these things&mdash;I have to go out and fight
      alone, while you are shut up in your churches, mumbling your spells and
      incantations, and poring over your Hebrew texts! And think of what I must
      suffer, knowing as I do that the spirit that animates you&mdash;the fervor
      and devotion, the 'hunger and thirst after righteousness'&mdash;would
      banish horror from the earth forever, if only it could be guided by
      intelligence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. All this, of course, was effort utterly wasted. Thyrsis poured
      out his pleadings and exhortations, his longing and his pain; and when he
      had finished, the girl was exactly where she had been before&mdash;just as
      distrustful of "science", and just as blindly bent upon getting away to
      her savages and binding up their wounds and baptizing them. And so at last
      he gave up in despair, and left Delia to go to bed, and went out and sat
      alone in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, though it was long after midnight, Corydon came out and joined
      him. He saw that she was flushed and trembling with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" she whispered. "That was a marvellous thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And all thrown away!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You realized that, did you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I realized many things. Why you set so much store by ideas, for instance!
      I see that you are right&mdash;one has to think straight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's like a steam-engine," said Thyrsis. "It doesn't matter how much
      power you get up, or how fast you make the wheels go&mdash;unless the
      switches are set right, you don't reach your destination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You only land in the ditch!" added Corydon. "And that's just the way I
      felt to-night&mdash;she'd take your argument every time, and dump it into
      a ditch. And she'd see it there, and not care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't care about facts at all, Corydon. And notice this also&mdash;she
      doesn't care about succeeding. That's the thing you must get straight&mdash;her
      religion is a religion of failure! It comes back to that criticism of
      Nietzsche's&mdash;it's a slave-morality. The world belongs to the devil;
      and the idea of taking it away from the devil seems to be presumptuous.
      Even if it could be done, the attempt would be 'unspiritual'; for the
      'world' is something corrupt&mdash;something that ought not to be saved.
      So you see, she's perfectly willing for the Belgians to have the rubber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's'!" quoted Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and let Caesar spend them on Cleo de Merode. What she wants is to
      save the <i>souls</i> of her savages&mdash;to baptize them, and to perish
      gloriously at the work, and then be transported to some future life that
      is worth while. So you see what the immortality-mongers do with our
      morality!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Corydon, swiftly. "But that need not be so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it <i>is</i> so!" he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" she protested. "You must not say that! That is giving up&mdash;and
      I felt such a different mood in you to-night! I wanted to tell you&mdash;we
      must do something about it, Thyrsis! It made me ashamed of my own life.
      Here I am, failing miserably&mdash;and all that work crying out to be
      done! I don't think I ever had such a sense of your power before&mdash;the
      things you might do, if only you could get free, if only I didn't stand in
      your way! Oh, can't we cast the old mistakes behind us, and go out into
      the world and preach that message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear," said Thyrsis, "that wouldn't appeal to you always. Your
      temperament&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind my temperament!" she cried. "I am sick of it, ashamed of it; I
      want the world to hear that trumpet-call! I want you to break your way
      into the churches&mdash;to make them listen to you, and realize their
      blasphemy of life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught hold of him and clung to him; he could feel, like an electric
      shock, the thrill of her excitement. He marvelled at the effect his words
      had produced upon her&mdash;realizing all the more keenly, in contrast
      with Delia, what a power of <i>mind</i> he had here to deal with.
      "Dearest," he said, "I must put these things into my books. You must stand
      by me and help me to put them into my books!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. Delia Gordon went away to take up her work in the city; but for
      many months thereafter that missionary impulse stayed with them. They
      would find themselves seized with the longing to throw aside everything
      else, and to go out and preach Socialism with the living voice. They were
      still immersed in its literature; they read Bellamy's "Looking Backward",
      and Blatchford's "Merrie England", and Kropotkin's "Appeal to the Young".
      They read another book about England that moved them even more&mdash;a
      volume of sketches called "The People of the Abyss", by a young writer who
      was then just forging to the front&mdash;Jack London. He was the most
      vital among the younger writers of the time, and Thyrsis watched his
      career with eager interest. There was also not a little of wistful hunger
      in his attitude&mdash;he had visions of being the next to be caught up and
      transported to those far-off heights of popularity and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, they were kept in a state of excitement by the Socialist papers and
      magazines that came to them. There was a great strike that summer, and
      they followed the progress of it, reading accounts of the distress of the
      people. Every now and then the pain of these things would prove more than
      Thyrsis could bear, and he would blaze out in some fiery protest, which,
      of course, the Socialist papers published gladly. So little by little
      Thyrsis was coming to be known in "the movement". Some of his friends
      among the editors and publishers made strenuous protests against this
      course, but little dreaming how deeply the new faith had impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth it was all that Thyrsis could do to hold himself in; it seemed to
      him that he no longer cared about anything save this fight of the
      working-class for justice. He was frightened by the prospect, when he
      stopped to realize it; for he could not write anything but what he
      believed, and one could not live by writing about Socialism. He thought of
      his war-book, for instance. It was but two or three months since he had
      finished it, and it was his one hope for success and freedom; and yet
      already he had outgrown it utterly. He realized that if he had had to go
      back and do it over, he could not; he could never believe in any war
      again, never be interested in any war again. Wars were struggles among
      ruling-classes, and whoever won them, the people always lost. Thyrsis was
      now girding up his loins for a war upon war.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there were times when it seemed that a literary career would no longer
      be possible to him; that he would have to cast his lot altogether with the
      people, and find his work as an agitator of the Revolution. One day a
      marvellous plan flashed over him, and he came to Corydon with it, and for
      nearly a week they threshed it over, tingling with excitement. They would
      sell their home, and raise what money they could, and get themselves a
      travelling van and a team of horses and go out upon the road on a
      Socialist campaign!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a perfectly feasible thing, Thyrsis declared: they would carry a
      supply of literature, and would get a commission upon subscriptions to
      Socialist papers. He pictured them drawing up on the main street of some
      country town, and ringing a dinner-bell to gather the people, and
      beginning a Socialist meeting. He would make a speech, and Corydon would
      sell pamphlets and books; they had animated discussions as to whether she
      might not learn to make a speech also. At least, he argued, she might sing
      Socialist songs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis was forever evolving plans of this sort; plans for doing something
      concrete, for coming into contact with the world of every day. The pursuit
      of literature was something so cold and aloof, so comfortable and
      conventional; one never pressed the hand of a person in distress, one
      never saw the light of hope and inspiration kindling in another's eyes. So
      he would dream of running a publishing-house or a magazine, of founding a
      library or staging a play, of starting a colony or a new religion. And
      then, after he had made himself drunk upon the imagining, he would take
      himself back to his real job. For that summer his only indiscretions were
      to buy several thousand copies of the "Appeal to Reason", and hire the old
      horse and buggy, and distribute them over some thirty square miles of
      country; also to help to organize a club for the study of Socialism at the
      university; and finally, when he was in the city, to make a fiery speech
      at a meeting of some "Christian Socialists." Because of this the newspaper
      reporters dug out the accounts of his earlier adventures, and "wrote him
      up" with malicious bantering. And this, alas&mdash;as the publisher
      pointed out&mdash;was a poor sort of preparation for the launching of the
      war-novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to add, the two did not fail to wrestle with those individuals
      whom they met. Thyrsis got a collection of pamphlets, judiciously
      selected, and gave them to the butcher and the grocer, the store-clerks
      and the hack-drivers in the town. But a college-town was a poor place for
      Socialist propaganda, as he realized with sinking heart; its population
      was made up of masters and servants, and there was even more snobbery
      among the servants than among the masters. The main architectural features
      of the place were fraternity-houses and "eating-clubs", where the sons of
      the idle rich disported themselves; once or twice Thyrsis passed through
      the town after midnight, and saw these young fellows reeling home, singing
      and screaming in various stages of intoxication. Then he would think of
      little children shut up in cotton-mills and coal-mines, of women dying in
      pottery-works and lead-factories; and on his way home he would compose a
      screed for the "Appeal to Reason".
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. Another victim of their fervor was the Rev. Mr. Harding, who
      stopped in to see them several times upon his tramps. Thyrsis would never
      have dreamed of troubling Mr. Harding, but Corydon found "something in
      him", and would go at him hammer and tongs whenever he appeared. It must
      have been a novel experience for the clergyman; it seemed to fascinate
      him, for he came again and again, and soon quite a friendship sprang up
      between the two. She would tell Thyrsis about it at great length, and so,
      of course, he had to change his ideas about Mr. Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see how fine and sensitive he is?" she would plead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, my dear," said Thyrsis. "But don't you think he's maybe just a
      bit timid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Timid," she replied. "But then think of his training! And think what you
      are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose I'm pretty bad," he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discussion took place after he and Mr. Harding had had an argument,
      in which Thyrsis had remarked casually that modern civilization was
      "crucifying Jesus all over again." And when Mr. Harding asked for
      enlightenment, Thyrsis answered, "My dear man, we crucify him according to
      the constitution. We teach the profession of crucifying him. We invest our
      capital in the business of crucifying him. We build churches and crucify
      him in his own name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After which explosion Corydon said, "You let me attend to Mr. Harding. I
      understand him, and how he feels about things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, my dear," assented Thyrsis. "When I see him coming, I'll
      disappear."
    </p>
    <p>
      But that would not do either, it appeared, for Mr. Harding was a
      conventional person, and it was necessary that he should feel he was
      calling on the head of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Thyrsis, "I'm supposed to sit by and serve as a chaperon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're to answer questions when I ask you to," replied Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Mr. Harding they made other acquaintances in Bellevue. There was a
      Mrs. Jennings, the wife of the young principal of the High School; they
      were simple and kindly people, who became fond of Corydon, and would beg
      her to visit them. The girl was craving for companionship, and she would
      plead with Thyrsis to accompany her, and subject himself to the agonies of
      "ping-pong" and croquet; and once or twice he submitted&mdash;and so one
      might have beheld them, at a lawn-party, hotly pressed by half a dozen
      disputants, in a debate concerning the nature of American institutions,
      and the future of religion and the home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis seldom took human relationships seriously enough to get excited in
      such arguments; but Corydon, with her intense and personal temperament,
      made an eager and uncomfortable propagandist. How could anyone fail to see
      what was so plain to her? And so she would bring books and pamphlets, and
      lend them about. There was a young man named Harry Stuart, a fine,
      handsome fellow, who taught drawing at the High School. In him, also,
      Cordon discovered possibilities; and she repudiated indignantly the idea
      that his soulful eyes and waving brown hair had anything to do with it.
      Harry Stuart was a guileless and enthusiastic member of the State militia;
      but in spite of this sinister fact, Corydon went at him. She soon had her
      victim burning the midnight oil over Kautsky and Hyndman; and behold,
      before the autumn had passed, the ill-fated drawing-teacher had resigned
      from the State militia, and was doing cartoons for the "Appeal to Reason"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Corydon's excitement over these questions was all the greater
      because she was just then making the discovery of the relationship of
      Socialism to the problems of her own sex. Some one sent her a copy of
      Charlotte Gilman's "Women and Economics"; she read it at a sitting, and
      brought it to Thyrsis, who thus came to understand the scientific basis of
      yet another article of his faith. He went on to other books&mdash;to
      Lester Ward's "Sociology", and to Bebel's "Woman", and to the works of
      Havelock Ellis. So he realized that women had not always been clinging
      vines and frail flowers and other uncomfortable things; and the hope that
      they might some day be interested in other matters than fashion and
      sentiment and the pursuit of the male, was not a vain fantasy and a
      Utopian dream, but was rooted in the vital facts of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout nature, it appeared, the female was often the equal of the
      male; and even in human history there had been periods when woman had held
      her own with man&mdash;when the bearing of children had not been a cause
      of degradation. Such had been the case with our racial ancestors, the
      Germans; as one found them in Tacitus, their women were strong and free,
      speaking with the men in the council-halls, and even going into battle if
      the need was great. It was only when they came under the Roman influence,
      and met slavery and its consequent luxury, that the Teutonic woman had
      started upon the downward path. Christianity also had had a great deal to
      do with it; or rather the dogmas which a Roman fanatic had imposed upon
      the message of Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interesting to note how one might trace the enslavement of woman,
      step by step with the enslavement of labor; the two things went hand in
      hand, and stood or fell together. So long as life was primitive, woman
      filled an economic function, and held her own with her mate. But with
      slavery and exploitation, the heaping up of wealth and the advent of the
      leisure-class <i>régime</i>, one saw the woman becoming definitely the
      appendage of the man, a household ornament and a piece of property;
      securing her survival, not by useful labor, but by sexual charm, and so
      becoming specialized as a sex-creature. For generations and ages the male
      had selected and bred in her those qualities which were most stimulating
      to his own desires, which increased in him the sense of his own dominance;
      and for generations and ages he taught the doctrine that the proper sphere
      of woman was the home. If he happened to be a German emperor, he summed it
      up in the sneer of "Kuche, Kinder, Kirche". So the woman became frail and
      impotent physically, and won her success by the only method that was open
      to her&mdash;by finding some male whom she could ensnare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been the conditions. But now, in the present century, had come
      machinery, and the development of woman's labor; and also had come
      intelligence, and woman's discovery of her chains. So there was the
      suffrage movement and the Socialist movement. After the overthrow of the
      competitive wage-system and of the leisure-class tradition, woman would no
      longer sell her sex-functions, whether in marriage or prostitution; and so
      the sex might cease to survive by its vices, and to infect the whole race
      with its intellectual and moral impotence. So would be set free the
      enormous force that was locked up in the soul of woman; and human life
      would be transformed by the impulse of emotions that were fundamental and
      primal. So Thyrsis perceived the two great causes in which the progress of
      humanity was bound up&mdash;the emancipation of labor and the emancipation
      of woman; to educate and agitate and organize for which became the one
      service that was worth while in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. The nights were beginning to grow chilly, and they realized that
      autumn was at hand, and faced the prospect of another winter in that
      lonely cabin. Paret, who had come down to visit them, had given it a name&mdash;"the
      soap-box in a marsh." Thyrsis saw clearly that he could not settle down to
      hard work while they were shut up there. Corydon's headaches and
      prostrations seemed to be growing worse, and she could simply not get
      through the winter without some help. As the book was ready, they had some
      money in prospect, and their idea was that they would buy a farm with a
      good house. So they might keep a horse and a cow and some chickens; and
      there might be some outdoor work for Thyrsis to do, instead of trudging
      aimlessly over the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      They utilized their spare time by getting the old horse and buggy, and
      inspecting and discussing all the farms within five miles of them; an
      occupation which put a great strain upon their diverse temperaments.
      Thyrsis would be thinking of such matters as roads and fruit-trees and
      barns&mdash;and above all of prices; while Corydon would be concerned with&mdash;alas,
      Corydon never dared to formulate her vision, even to herself. She had
      vague memories of dilettante country-places with great open fire-places,
      and exposed beams, and a broad staircase, and a deep piazza, and above
      all, a view of the sunset. Whenever she came upon any vague suggestion of
      these luxuries, her heart would leap up&mdash;and would then be crushed by
      some reference to ten or fifteen thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon was a poor sort of person to take an inspection-trip. She would
      gaze about and say, "There might be a piazza here"; and then she would
      look across the fields and add, "There'd be a good view if it weren't for
      those woods"&mdash;and wave the woods away with the gesture of a duchess.
      So, of course, the observant farmer would add a thousand dollars to the
      asking-price of his property.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, when Thyrsis with his remorseless thoroughness would
      insist on getting out and inspecting some dilapidated and forlorn-looking
      place&mdash;then what agonies would come! Corydon would pass through the
      rooms, suffering all the horrors which she might have suffered in years of
      occupancy of them. And there was no use pleading with her to be reserved
      in her attitude&mdash;she took houses in the same way that she took
      people, either loving them or hating them. So, from an afternoon's
      driving-trip, she would come home in a state of exhaustion and despair;
      and Thyrsis would have to pledge himself upon oath not to think of this or
      that horrible place for a single instant again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when Thyrsis, too, in spite of his lack of intuition,
      felt the atmosphere of evil which hung about some of these old farms.
      Having lived for a year and a half in the neighborhood, and been favored
      with the gossip of the washerwoman, and of the farmer's wife, and of the
      girl who came to clean house now and then, they had come to know the
      affairs of their neighbors&mdash;they had got a cross-section of an
      American small-farming community. It was in amusing accord with Thyrsis'
      social theories that the only two decent families in the neighborhood
      inhabited farms of over a hundred acres. There were several farms of fifty
      or sixty acres occupied by tenants, who were engaged, in plundering them
      as fast as they could; and then a host of little places, of from one to
      twenty acres, on which families were struggling pitifully to keep alive.
      And with scarcely a single exception, these homes of poverty were also
      homes of degradation. Across the way from Thyrsis was an idiot man; upon
      the next place lived an old man who was a hopeless drunkard, and had one
      son insane, and another tubercular; and then down in the meadows below the
      woods lived the Hodges&mdash;a name of direful portent. The father would
      work as a laborer in town for a day or two, and buy vinegar and make
      himself half insane, and then come home and beat his wife and children.
      There were eleven of these latter, and a new one came each year; the
      eldest were thieves, and the youngest might be seen in midwinter, playing
      half-naked before the house. The Hodges were known to all the neighbors
      for miles about, and the amount of energy which each farmer expended in
      fighting them would have maintained the whole family in comfort for their
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had travelled enough about the New England and Middle Atlantic
      states to know that these conditions were typical of the small-farming
      industry in all the remoter parts. The people with enterprise had moved
      West, and those who stayed behind divided and mortgaged their farms, and
      sunk lower and lower into misery and degradation. This was one more aspect
      of that noble system of <i>laissez faire</i>; this was the independent
      small-farmer, whose happiness was the theme of all orthodox economists! He
      was, according to the newspaper editorials, the backbone of American
      civilization; and once every two years, in November, he might be counted
      upon to hitch up his buggy and drive to town, and pocket his two-dollar
      bill, and roll up a glorious majority for the Grand Old Party of
      Protection and Prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. The date of publication of the book had come at last. It was
      being generously advertised, under the imprint of a leading house; and
      Thyrsis' heart warmed to see the advertisements. This at last, he felt,
      was success; and then the reviews began to come in, and his heart warmed
      still more. Here was a new note in current fiction, said the critics; here
      were power and passion, a broad sweep and a genuine poetic impulse.
      American history had never been treated like this before, American ideals
      had never been voiced like this before. And these, Thyrsis noted, were the
      opinions of the representative reviews&mdash;not those of obscure
      provincial newspapers. Victory, it seemed, had come to him at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came up to the metropolis on the strength of these triumphs; for he had
      observed that when one had a new book coming out was the psychological
      moment to attack the magazine-editors. One was a personality then, and
      could command attention. It was the height of a presidential campaign, and
      the Socialists were making an impression which was astonishing every one.
      The idea had occurred to Thyrsis that some magazine might judge it worth
      while to tell its readers about this new and picturesque movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great delight the editor of "Macintyre's Monthly" looked with favor
      upon the suggestion, and asked to see an article at once. So Thyrsis shut
      himself up in a hotel-room and wrote it over night. It proved to be so
      full of "ginger" that the editorial staff of Macintyre's was delighted,
      and made suggestions as to another article; at which point Thyrsis made a
      desperate effort and summoned up his courage, and insinuated politely that
      his stuff was worth five cents a word. The editor-in-chief replied
      promptly that that seemed to him proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred dollars for an article! Here indeed was fame! The author went
      home, and thought out another one, and after a week came up to the city
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this new article Thyrsis cited a presidential candidate before the bar
      of public opinion, and propounded troublesome questions to him. Here was
      the capital of the country, heaping itself up at compound interest, and
      demanding dividends; here were the people, scraping and struggling to
      furnish the necessary profits. Would they always be able to furnish
      enough; and what would happen when they could no longer furnish them? Here
      were franchises obtained by bribery, and capitalized for hundreds of
      millions of dollars; and these millions, too, were heaping up
      automatically. Were they to draw their interest and dividends forever?
      Here were the machines of production, increasing by leaps and bounds, and
      the product increasing still faster, and all counting upon foreign
      markets. What would happen when Japan had its own machines, and India had
      its own machines, and China had its own machines? Again, the processes of
      production were being perfected, and displacing men; here were panics and
      crises, displacing&mdash;yet more men. Already, in England, a good fourth
      of the population had been displaced; and what were these displaced
      populations to do? They had finished making over the earth for the
      capitalists; and now that the work was done, there seemed to be no longer
      any place on the earth for them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the problems of our time, according to Thyrsis; and why did the
      statesmen of the time have nothing to say about them? When this article
      had been read and discussed, young "Billy" Macintyre himself sent for
      Thyrsis. This was the "real thing", said he, with his genial <i>bonhomie</i>;
      the five hundred thousand subscribers of Macintyre's must surely have
      these mirth-provoking meditations. Also, the editors themselves needed
      badly to be stirred up by such live ideas; therefore would Thyrsis come to
      dinner next Friday evening, and, as "Billy" phrased it, "throw a little
      Socialism at them"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. So Thyrsis moved one step higher yet up the ladder of success.
      The younger Macintyre occupied half a block of mansion up on Riverside
      Drive&mdash;just across the street from the town-house of Barry Creston's
      father. Thyrsis found himself in an entrance-hall where wonderful pictures
      loomed vaguely in a dim, religious light; and a silent footman took his
      cap, and then escorted him by a soft, plush-covered stairway to the
      apartments of "Billy", who was being helped into a dress-suit by his
      valet. Thyrsis, alas, had no dress-suit, and no valet to help him into it,
      but he sat on the edge of a big leather chair and proceeded to "throw a
      little Socialism" at his host. Then they went down stairs, and there were
      Morris and Hemingway, of the editorial staff, and "Buddie" Comings, most
      popular of novelists, and "Bob" Desmond, most famous of illustrators. And
      a little later on came Macintyre the elder, who had also been judged to
      stand in need of some Socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macintyre the elder was white-haired and rosy-cheeked. He had begun life
      as an emigrant-boy, running errands for a book-shop. In course of time he
      had become a partner, and then had started a cheap magazine for the
      printing of advertisements. From this had come the reprinting of cheap
      books for premiums; until now, after forty years, Macintyre's was one of
      the leading publishing-concerns of the country. Recently the important
      discovery had been made that the printing of half-inch advertisements
      headed "FITS" and "OBESITY" prevented the securing of full-page
      advertisements about automobiles. The former kind was therefore being
      diverted to the religious papers of the country, whose subscribers were
      now getting the "blood of the lamb" diluted with twenty-five per cent.
      alcohol and one and three-fourths per cent. opium. But such facts were not
      allowed to interfere with the optimistic philosophy of "Macintyre's
      Monthly".
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Macintyre seemed to Thyrsis the most naïve and lovable old soul
      he had encountered in many a year. When he espied Thyrsis, he waited for
      no preliminaries, but went up to him as he stood by the fire-place, and
      put an arm about him, and led him off to a seat by the window. "I want to
      talk to you," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," he went on, "I read that article of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which one?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last one. And you know, Billy's got to stop putting things like that
      in the magazine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried Thyrsis, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't have it! He must not print that article!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he's accepted it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. But he should have consulted me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but I wrote it at his order. And he promised to pay me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right," said the old gentleman, with a genial smile.
      "We'll pay for it, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause, while Thyrsis caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," continued the other, "that's a terrible article!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um," said the author&mdash;"possibly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you write such things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it true, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macintyre pondered. "You know," he said, "I think you are a very
      clever fellow, and you know a lot; much more than I do, I've no doubt. But
      what I don't understand is, why don't you put it into a book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Into a book?" echoed Thyrsis, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," explained the other&mdash;"then it won't hurt anybody but yourself.
      Why should you try to get it into my magazine, and scare away my
      half-million subscribers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. They went in to dinner, which was served upon silver-plate, by
      the light of softly-shaded candles; and while the velvet-footed waiters
      caused their food to appear and disappear by magic, Thyrsis fulfilled his
      mission and "threw Socialism" at the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company had its guns loaded, and they went at it hot and heavy. The
      editors wanted to know about "the home" under Socialism; to which Thyrsis
      made retort by picturing "the home" under capitalism. They wanted to know
      about liberty and individuality under Socialism; and so Thyrsis discussed
      the liberty and individuality of the hundred thousand wage-slaves of the
      Steel Trust. They sought to tangle him in discussions as to the
      desirability of competition, and the impossibility of escaping it; but
      Thyrsis would bring them back again and again to the central fact of
      exploitation, which was the one fact that counted. They insisted upon
      knowing how this, that, and the other thing would be done in the
      Cooperative Commonwealth; to which Thyrsis answered, "Do you ask for a map
      of heaven before you join the Church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was "Billy" Macintyre who brought up a somewhat delicate question; how
      would such an institution as "Macintyre's Monthly" be run under Socialism?
      Thyrsis replied by quoting Kautsky's formula: "Communism in material
      production, Anarchism in intellectual". He showed how the state might
      print and bind and distribute, while men in "free associations" might edit
      and publish. But one could not get very far in this exposition, because of
      the excitement of the elder Macintyre. For the old gentleman was like a
      small boy who is being robbed of his marbles; if there had been a mob
      outside his publishing-house, he could not have been more agitated. He
      took occasion to state, with the utmost solemnity, that he disapproved of
      such discussions; and "Billy", who sat between him and Thyrsis, had to
      interfere now and then and soothe the "pater" down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macintyre's views on the subject of capitalism were simple and easy to
      understand. There could be nothing really wrong with a system which had
      brought so many great and good men into control of the country's affairs.
      Mr. Macintyre knew this, because he had played golf with them all and gone
      yachting with them all. And this was a perfectly genuine conviction; if
      there had been the slightest touch of sham in it, the old gentleman would
      have been more cautious in the examples he chose. He would name man after
      man who was among the most notorious of the country's "malefactors of
      great wealth"&mdash;men whose financial crimes had been proven beyond any
      possibility of doubting. He would name them in a voice overflowing with
      affection and admiration, as benefactors of humanity upon a cosmic scale;
      and of course that would end the argument in a gale of laughter. When the
      elder Macintyre entered the discussion, all the rest of the company moved
      forthwith to Thyrsis' side, and there were six Socialists confronting one
      business-man. And this was a very puzzling and alarming thing to the old
      gentleman&mdash;his son and his magazine were getting away from him, and
      he did not know what to make of the phenomenon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13. Thyrsis judged that the tidings must have got about that there
      was a new "lion" in town; for a couple of days after this he was called up
      by Comings, most popular of novelists, who asked him to have luncheon at
      the "Thistle" club. And when Thyrsis went, Comings explained that Mrs.
      Parmley Fatten had read his book, and was anxious to meet him, and
      requested that he be brought round to tea. The other was tactless enough
      to let it transpire that he knew nothing about Mrs. Patton; but Comings
      was too tactful to show his surprise. Mrs. Patton, he explained, was
      socially prominent&mdash;was looked upon as the leader of a set that went
      in for intellectual things. She was interested in social reform and
      woman's suffrage, and was worth helping along; and besides that, she was a
      charming woman&mdash;Thyrsis would surely find the adventure worth while.
      Then suddenly, while he was listening, it flashed over Thyrsis that he <i>had</i>
      heard of Mrs. Patton before; the lady was in mourning for her brother, and
      Corydon had recently handed him a "society" item, which told of some
      unique and striking "mourning-hosiery" which she was introducing from
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis in former days might have been shy of this phenomenon; but at
      present he was a collecting economist on the look-out for specimens, and
      so he said he would go. He met Comings again at five o'clock, and they
      strolled out Fifth Avenue together to Mrs. Patton's brown-stone palace.
      Thyrsis observed that his friend had been considerate enough to omit his
      afternoon change of costume, and for this he was grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Patton was still in mourning, a filmy and diaphanous kind of
      mourning, beautiful enough to placate the angel Azrael himself. A filmy
      and diaphanous creature was Mrs. Patton also&mdash;one could never have
      dreamed of so exquisite a black butterfly. She was very sweet and
      sympathetic, and told Thyrsis how much she had liked his book&mdash;so
      that Thyrsis concluded she was not half so bad as he had expected. After
      all, she might not have been to blame for the hosiery story&mdash;it might
      even have been a lie. He reflected that the yellow journals no doubt lied
      as freely about young leaders of intellectual sets in "society" as they
      did about starving authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Patton wanted to know about Socialism, and sighed because it seemed
      so far away. She made several remarks that showed real intelligence&mdash;and
      this was startling to Thyrsis, who would as soon have expected
      intelligence from a real butterfly. He got a strange impression of a
      personality struggling to get into contact with life from behind a wall
      some ten million dollars high. Mrs. Patton had three young children, and
      her husband was one of the "Standard Oil crowd"; she complained to Thyrsis
      that "Parmy"&mdash;so she referred to the gentleman&mdash;was always in
      terror over her vagaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new discovery to the author that the very rich might live under
      the shadow of fear, quite as much as the very poor. Their wealth made them
      a target for newspaper satire, so that they dared not depart from
      convention in the slightest detail. Mrs. Patton told how once she had
      ventured to romp for a few minutes with some children on the grounds of
      the "Casino", and the next day all the world had read that she was
      introducing "tag" as a diversion for the Newport colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came other callers, both women and men; Percy Ambler, man of fashion
      and dilettante poet; and with him little Murray Symington, who wrote the
      literary chat for "Knickerbocker's Weekly", and was therefore a power to
      be propitiated. There came Blanchard, the young and progressive publisher
      of the "Beau Monde", a weekly whose circulation rivalled that of
      "Macintyre's". There came also young Macklin, Mrs. Patton's nephew, with
      his monocle and his killing drawl. Macklin came by these honestly, having
      been brought up in England; but Thyrsis did not know that&mdash;he only
      heard the young gentleman's passing reference to his yacht, and to his
      passion for the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé; and so he had it in for
      Macklin. Thyrsis had got involved in a serious discussion with Mrs. Patton
      and Symington, and was in the act of saying that the social problem could
      not be much longer left unsolved; and then he chanced to turn, and
      discovered young Macklin, surveying him with elaborate superciliousness,
      and asking with his British drawl, "Aw&mdash;I beg pawdon&mdash;but what
      do you mean by the social problem?" And Thyrsis, with a quick glance at
      him, answered, "I mean you." So Macklin subsided; and Thyrsis learned
      afterwards that his remark was going the rounds, being considered to be a
      <i>mot</i>. It appeared the next week in the columns of a paper devoted to
      "society" gossip; and many a literary reputation had been made by a lesser
      triumph than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis got new light upon the making of reputations, when he looked into
      the next issue of "Knickerbocker's Weekly". There he found that Murray
      Symington had devoted no less than three paragraphs to his personality and
      his book. It was all "sprightly"&mdash;that was Murray's tone&mdash;but
      also it was cordial; and it referred to Thyrsis' earlier novel, "The
      Hearer of Truth", as "that brilliant piece of work". Thyrsis read this
      with consternation&mdash;recalling that when the book had come out, not
      two years ago, "Knickerbocker's Weekly" had referred to it as a
      "preposterous concoction". Could it be true that an author's work was
      "preposterous" while he was starving in a garret, and became "brilliant"
      when he was found in the drawing-room of Mrs. "Parmy" Patton?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 14. Thyrsis went on to penetrate yet deeper into these mysteries;
      there came a call from Murray Symington, to say that Mrs. Jesse Dyckman
      wanted him to dinner. Jesse Dyckman he recognized as the name of one of
      the most popular contributors to the magazines&mdash;his short stories of
      Fifth Avenue life were the delight of the readers of the "Beau Monde".
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't go to dinner-parties with women!" protested Thyrsis. "I don't
      dress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Murray took that message; but in a few minutes he called up again. "She
      says she doesn't care whether you dress or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then, I don't <i>eat!</i>" protested Thyrsis, who had recently
      discovered Horace Fletcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know <i>that</i> won't count," said the other, laughing. "She doesn't
      want you to eat&mdash;she wants you to talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jesse Dyckman inhabited an apartment in a "studio-building" not far
      from Central Park; and here was more luxury and charm&mdash;a dining-room
      done in dark red, with furniture of some black wood, and candles and
      silver and cut glass, quite after the fashion of the Macintyres. Thyrsis
      was admitted by a French maid-servant; and there was Mrs. Dyckman,
      resplendent in white shoulders and a necklace of pearls; and there was
      Dyckman himself, even more prosperous and contented-looking than his
      pictures, and even more brilliant and cynical than his tales. Also there
      was his sister, Mrs. Partridge, the writer of musical comedies; and a Miss
      Taylor, who filled the odd corners of the magazines with verses, which
      Corydon had once described as "cheap cheer-up stuff".
    </p>
    <p>
      So here was the cream of the "literary world"; and Thyrsis, as he watched
      and listened to it, was working out the formula of magazine success. Mrs.
      Dyckman sat next to him, displaying her shoulders and her culture; it
      seemed to him that she must have spent all her spare time picking up
      phrases about the books and pictures and plays and music of the hour, so
      as to be ready for possible mention of them at her dinner-parties. She had
      opinions on tap about everything; opinions just enough "advanced" to be
      striking and original, and yet not too far "advanced" for good form. Jesse
      Dyckman's short stories were the sort in which you read how the hero
      handled his cigarette, and were told that the heroine was clad in "dimity
      <i>en princesse"</i>. You learned the names of the latest fashionable
      drinks, and the technicalities of automobiles, and met with references to
      far-off and intricate standards of social excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Thyrsis it appeared that he could see before him the whole career of
      such a man. He had trained himself by years of apprenticeship in snobbery;
      he had studied the fashions not only in costume and manners, but also in
      books and opinions. He had been educated in a "fraternity", and had chosen
      a wife who had been educated in a "sorority"; they had set up in this
      apartment, with silver service and three French servants, and proceeded to
      give dinners, and cultivate people who "counted." And so had come the
      pleasant berth with the "Beau Monde"; one or two stories every month, and
      one thousand dollars for each story&mdash;as one might read in all
      newspaper accounts of the "earnings of authors".
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Beau Monde" might have been described as a magazine for the
      standardizing of the newly-rich. A group of these existed in every town in
      the country, and had their "society" in every little city. They would come
      to New York and put up at expensive hotels, and get their education in
      theatres and opera-houses and "lobster-palaces"; in addition they had this
      weekly messenger of good form. In its advertising-columns one read of the
      latest things in cigarettes and highballs and haberdashery and candies and
      autos; and in its reading-matter one found the leisure-class world, and
      the leisure-class idea of all other worlds. Young Blanchard himself was in
      the most "exclusive" society; and if one stayed close to him, one might
      worm his way past the warders. Among the regular contributors to the "Beau
      Monde" and to "Macintyre's", there were a dozen men who had risen by this
      method; and some of them had been real writers at the outset&mdash;had
      started with a fund of vigor, at least. But now they spent their evenings
      at dinner-parties, and their days lounging about in two or three expensive
      cafés, reading the afternoon papers, exchanging gossip, and acquiring the
      necessary stock of cynicism for their next picture of leisure-class life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was what might have been described as the "court method" of literary
      achievement. The centre of it was the young prince who held the
      purse-strings; and the court was a coterie of bookish men of fashion and
      rich women whose husbands were occupied in the stock-market. They set the
      tone and dispensed the favors; one who stood in their good graces would be
      practically immune to criticism, no matter how seedy his work might come
      to be. Nobody liked to "roast" a man with whom he had played golf at a
      week-end party; and who could be so impolite as to slight the work of a
      lady-poetess whom he had taken in to dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 15. Thyrsis studied these people, and measured himself against them.
      He was not blinded by any vanity; he knew that it would not have taken him
      a week to turn out a short story which would have had the requisite
      qualities for Macintyre's&mdash;which would have been clever and
      entertaining, would have had genuine sentiment, and as large a proportion
      of sincerity as the magazine admitted. He could have suggested that he
      thought it was worth five hundred dollars, and "Billy" Macintyre would
      have nodded and sent him a check. And then he could have moved up to town,
      and got a frock-coat, and paid another call upon Mrs. "Parmy" Patton. Then
      his friend Comings would have put him up for the "Thistle", he would have
      got to know the men who made literary opinion, and so his career would
      have been secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor need he have made any apparent break with his convictions. In
      "society" one met all sorts of eccentrics&mdash;"babus" and "yogis",
      Christian Scientists, spiritualists and theosophists, Fletcherites,
      vegetarians and "raw-fooders". And there would be ample room for his fad&mdash;it
      was quite "English" to be touched with Socialism. All that one had to do
      was to be entertaining in one's presentation of it, and to confine one's
      self to its literary aspects&mdash;not setting forth plans for the
      expropriation of the house of Macintyre!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had one grievous handicap, of course. He would have had to keep
      his wife and child in the background; for Corydon, alas, would not have
      scored as a giver of dinner-parties. From a woman like Mrs. Jesse Dyckman,
      skilled in intellectual fence, and merciless to her inferiors, Corydon
      would have turned tail and fled. Thyrsis was able to sit by and let Mrs.
      Dyckman wave the plumes of her wit and spread the tail-feathers of her
      culture before his astonished eyes, and at the same time occupy his mind
      with studying her, and working out her "economic interpretation". But
      Corydon took life too intensely, and people too personally for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would have let him go, if he had told her that it was best. So why
      should he not do it&mdash;why should he turn his back upon this
      opportunity, and return to the "soap-box in a marsh" to wrestle with
      loneliness and want? The fact of the matter was that the thing which
      seemed so easy to his intellect, was impossible to his character. Thyrsis
      could not have anything to do with these people without hypocrisy; merely
      to sit and talk pleasantly with them was to lie. They were to him the
      enemy, the thing he was in life to fight. And he hated all that they stood
      for in the world&mdash;he hated their ideas and their institutions, their
      virtues as well as their vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been down into the bottom-most pit of hell, and the sights that he
      had seen there had withered him up. How could he derive enjoyment from
      silks and jewels, from rich foods and fine wines, when he heard in his
      ears the cries of agony of the millions he had left behind him in that
      seething abyss? And should he trample upon their faces, as so many others
      had trampled? Should he make a ladder of their murdered hopes, to climb
      out to fame and fortune? Not he!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him sometimes, as he thought about it, that he alone, of all
      men living, had power to voice the despair of these tortured souls. Others
      had been down into that pit, and had come out alive; but who was there
      among them that was an <i>artist;</i> that could forge his hatred into a
      weapon, sharp enough and stout enough to be driven through the tough hide
      of the world of culture? To be an artist meant to have spent years and
      decades in toil and study, in disciplining and drilling one's powers; and
      who was there that had descended into the social inferno, and had come
      back with strength enough to accomplish that labor?
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seemed to him that he was the bearer of a gospel, that he had to
      teach the world something it could otherwise not know. He had tried out
      upon his own person, and upon the persons of his loved ones, the effects
      of poverty and destitution, of cold and hunger, of solitude and sickness
      and despair. And so he knew, of his own knowledge, the meaning of the
      degradation that he saw in modern society&mdash;of suicide and insanity,
      of drunkenness and vice and crime, of physical and mental and moral decay.
      He knew, and none could dispute him! Therefore he must nerve himself for
      the struggle; he must deliver that message, and pound home that truth. He
      must keep on and on&mdash;in defiance of authority, in the face of all the
      obloquy and ridicule that the prostitute powers of civilization could heap
      upon him. He must live for that work, and die for it&mdash;to make real to
      the thinking world the infamies and the horrors of the capitalist <i>régime</i>.

      Section 1. Thyrsis came back to his home in the country, divided between
      satisfaction over the four hundred dollars worth of booty he had captured,
      and a great uneasiness concerning his novel. It had had with the critics
      all the success that he could have asked, but unfortunately it did not
      seem to be selling. Already it had been out three weeks, and the sales had
      been only a thousand copies. The publisher confessed himself disappointed,
      but said that it was too early to be certain; they must allow time for the
      book to make its way, for the opinions of the reviews to take effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, for week after week, Thyrsis watched and hoped against hope&mdash;the
      old, heart-sickening experience. In the end he came to realize that he had
      achieved that most cruel of all literary ironies, the <i>succés</i> <i>d'estime</i>.
      The critics agreed that he had written a most unusual book; but then, the
      critics did not really count&mdash;they had no way of making their verdict
      effective. What determined success or failure was the department-store
      public. It would take a whim for a certain novel; and when a novel had
      once begun to sell, it would be advertised and pushed to the front, and
      everything else would give way before it, quite regardless of what the
      critic's had said. A book-review appeared only once, but an advertisement
      might appear a score of times, and be read all over the country. So the
      public would have pounded into its consciousness the statement that
      "Hearts Aflame", by Dorothy Dimple, was a masterpiece of
      character-drawing, full of thrilling incident and alive with pulsing
      passion. The department-store public, which was not intelligent enough to
      distinguish between a criticism and an advertisement, would accept all
      these opinions at their face-value. And that was success; even the critics
      bowed to it in the end&mdash;as you might note by the change in their tone
      when they came to review the next work by this "popular" novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis faced the ghastly truth that another year and a half of toiling
      and waiting had gone for nothing&mdash;the heights of opportunity were
      almost as far away as ever. He had to summon up his courage and nerve
      himself for yet another climb; and Corydon would have to face the prospect
      of another winter in the "soap-box in a marsh".
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now November, and Thyrsis had written nothing but Socialist
      manifestoes for six months. He was restless and chafing again; but living
      in distress as they were, he could not get his thoughts together at all.
      He must have been a trying person to live in the house with at such a
      time. "You ask me to take love for granted," said Corydon to him once;
      "but how can I, when your every expression is contradictory to love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he explain to her his trouble? Here again was the pressure of
      that dreadful "economic screw", that was crushing their love, and all
      beauty and joy and hope in their hearts. They might fight against it with
      all the power of their beings; they might fall down upon their knees
      together, and pledge themselves with anguish in their voices and tears in
      their eyes; but still the remorseless pressure would go on, day and night,
      week after week, without a moment's respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was this little house, for instance. It was all that Thyrsis wanted,
      and all that he would ever have wanted; and yet he could not be happy in
      it, because Corydon was not happy in it. He must be plotting and planning
      and worrying, straining every nerve to get to another house; he might not
      even think of any other possibility&mdash;that would be treason to her. So
      always it seemed&mdash;he had to turn his face a way that he did not wish
      to travel, he had to go on against every instinct of his own nature. His
      love for Corydon was such that he would be ashamed whenever his own
      instincts showed themselves. But then he would go alone, and try to do his
      work, and then discover the havoc this had wrought in his own being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now the tension had reached the breaking point; the craving for
      solitude and peace was eating him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it that you want?" asked Corydon, one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be where I don't have to see anybody," he cried. "I want to
      rough it in a tent, as I did once before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's too late to go to the Adirondacks, Thyrsis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," he said. "But there are other places."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard of one in Virginia&mdash;in that very Wilderness of which he
      had written so eloquently, but had never seen. "Isn't there some one who
      could come and stay with you?" he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," replied Corydon. But the next day, as fate would have it,
      there came a letter from Delia Gordon, saying that she had finished a
      certain stage of her study-course, and was tired out and in fear of
      break-down. So an invitation was sent and accepted, and Thyrsis secured
      the respite which he craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so behold him as a hermit once more, settled in a deserted cabin not
      far from the battle-field of Spotsylvania. He had got rid of the vermin in
      the cabin by burning sulphur, and had stocked his establishment with a
      canvas-cot and a camp-stool and a lamp and an oil-can, and the usual
      supply of beans and bacon and rice and corn-meal and prunes. Also he had
      built himself a rustic table, and unpacked a trunkful of blankets and
      dishes and writing-pads and books. So once more his life was his own, and
      a thing of delight to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had promised himself to live off the country, as he had before; but the
      principal game here was the wild turkey, and the wild turkey proved itself
      a shy and elusive bird. It was not occupied with meditations concerning
      literary masterpieces; and so it had a great advantage over Thyrsis, who
      would forget that he had a gun with him after the first half-hour of a
      "hunt".
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. It had now become clear to Thyrsis that he had nothing more to
      expect from his novel; it had sold less than two thousand copies, which
      meant that it had not earned the money which had already been advanced to
      him. But all that was now ancient history&mdash;the entrenchments and
      graveyards of the Wilderness battlefield were not more forgotten and
      overgrown with new life than was the war-book in Thyrsis' mind. He had had
      enough of being a national chronicler which the nation did not want; he
      had come down to the realities of the hour, to the blazing protest of the
      new Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years now Thyrsis had been playing at the game of professional
      authorship; he had studied the literary world both high and low, and had
      seen enough to convince him that it was an impossible thing to produce art
      in such a society. The modern world did not know what art was, it was
      incapable of forming such a concept. That which it called "art" was fraud
      and parasitism&mdash;its very heart was diseased.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the essence of art was unselfishness; it was an emotion which
      overflowed, and which sought to communicate itself to others from an
      impulse of pure joy. It was of necessity a social thing; the supreme
      art-products of the race had been, like the Greek tragedy and the Gothic
      cathedral, a result of the labor of a whole community. And what could the
      modern man, a solitary and predatory wolf in the wilderness of <i>laissez</i>
      <i>faire</i>&mdash;what could he conceive of such a state of soul? What
      would happen to a man who gave himself up to such a state of soul, in a
      community where the wolf-law and the wolf-customs prevailed?
    </p>
    <p>
      A grim purpose had been forming itself in Thyrsis' mind. He would suppress
      the artist in himself for the present&mdash;he would do it, cost whatever
      agony it might. He would turn propagandist for a while; instead of
      scattering his precious seed in barren soil, he would set to work to make
      the soil ready. There was seething in his mind a work of revolutionary
      criticism, which would sweep into the rubbish-heap the idols of the
      leisure-class world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his idea to go back to first principles; to study the bases of
      modern society, and show how its customs and institutions came to be, and
      interpret its art as a product of these. He would show what the modern
      artist was, and how he got his living, and how this moulded his work. He
      would take the previous art-periods of history and study them, showing by
      what stages the artist had evolved, and so gaining a stand-point from
      which to prophesy what he would come to be in the future. Only once had an
      attempt ever been made to apply to questions of art the methods of science&mdash;in
      Nordau's "Degeneration". But then Nordau's had been pseudo-science&mdash;three-quarters
      impertinence and conceit. The world still waited to understand its
      art-products in the light of scientific Socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the task which Thyrsis was planning. It would mean years of
      study, and how he was to get the means to do it, he could not guess. But
      he had his mind made up to do it, though it might be the last of his
      labors, though everything else in his life might end in shipwreck. He went
      about all day, possessed with the idea; it would be a colossal work, an
      epoch-making work&mdash;it would be the culmination of his efforts and the
      vindication of his claims. It would save the men who came after him; and
      to save the men who came after him had now become the formula of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. Thyrsis would come back from a sojourn such as this with all his
      impulses of affection and sympathy renewed; he would have had time to miss
      Corydon, and to realize how closely he was bound to her. He would be eager
      to tell her all his adventures, and the wonderful plans which he had
      formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time it was Corydon who had adventures to narrate. He realized as
      soon as he saw her that she had something upon her mind; and at the first
      occasion she led him off to his own study, and shut the door. He got a
      fire going, and she sat opposite him and gazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she said, "I hardly know how to begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very formal and mysterious. "What is it, dear?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's something terrible," she whispered. "I'm afraid you're going to be
      angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he repeated, more anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was angry myself, at first," she said; "but I've got over it now. And I
      want you please to be reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis," she whispered, after a pause, "it's Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Stuart, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said he. He had all but forgotten the young drawing-teacher, whom he
      had left doing Socialist cartoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Thyrsis, I always liked him very much. And he's been coming up
      here&mdash;quite a good deal. I didn't see why he shouldn't come&mdash;Delia
      liked him too, and she was with us most of the time. Was it wrong of me to
      let him come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said he. "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it's silly of me," Corydon continued, hesitatingly&mdash;"but I'm
      always imagining things about people. And he seemed to me to have such
      possibilities. He has&mdash;how shall I say it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recall your saying he had soulful eyes," put in Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll make fun of it all, of course," said Corydon. "But it's really
      very tragic. You see, he's never met a woman like me before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can believe that, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;a woman that has any real ideas. He would ask me questions
      by the hour; and we talked about everything. So, of course, we talked
      about love; and he&mdash;he asked if I was happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Thyrsis, grimly. "Of course you said that you were
      miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't say much. I told him that your work was hard, and that my
      courage wasn't always equal to my task. Anyone can see that I have
      suffered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear," said Thyrsis, "of course. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, one day&mdash;it was last Friday&mdash;he came up with a carriage
      to take us driving. And Delia had a headache, and wanted to rest, and so
      Harry and I went alone. I&mdash;I guess I shouldn't have gone, but I
      didn't realize it. It was a beautiful afternoon, and we both had a good
      time&mdash;in fact, I don't know when I have been so contentedly happy. We
      stopped to gather wild flowers, and once we sat by a little stream; and of
      course, we talked and talked, and before I realized it, twilight was
      falling, and we were a long way from home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," said Thyrsis, as she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We started out. I recollected later, though I didn't seem to notice it at
      the time&mdash;that Harry's voice seemed to grow husky, and he spoke
      indistinctly. He had let the horse have the reins, and his arm was on the
      back of my seat. I hadn't noticed it; but then&mdash;then&mdash;fancy my
      horror&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened&mdash;all of a sudden." Corydon stammered, her cheeks turning
      scarlet. "I felt his arm clasp me; and I turned and stared, and his face
      was close to mine, and his eyes were fairly shining."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "What did you do?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just looked at him calmly, and said, 'Oh, how <i>could</i> you?' And at
      that he took his arm away quickly, and sat up stiff and straight, with a
      terribly hurt expression. 'Forgive me,' he said. 'I was mad.' And we
      neither of us spoke a word all the way home. And when we came to the
      house, I jumped out of the carriage without saying good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon sat staring at her husband, with her wide-open, anxious eyes. "And
      was that all?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day I had a letter from him. He said he was going away, over the
      Christmas holidays. He said that he was very much ashamed of himself, and
      he hoped that I would be able to forgive him. And that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat for a while in silence. "You won't be too angry?" asked Corydon,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not angry at all," he said. "But naturally it's disturbing. I don't
      like to have such things happen to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's strange, you know," said Corydon, "but I haven't seemed to stay very
      indignant. He was so hurt, you know&mdash;and I can realize how unhappy
      he's been. Curiously enough, I've even found myself thinking that I'd like
      to see him again. And that puzzled me. I felt that I ought to be quite
      outraged. That he should imagine he could hug me&mdash;like any
      shop-girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent many hours discussing this adventure; in fact it was a week or
      two before they had disposed of it entirely. Thyrsis was hoping that the
      experience might be utilized to persuade Corydon to modify her utopian
      attitude towards young men with soulful eyes and waving brown hair. He was
      at some pains to set forth to her the psychology of the male creature&mdash;insisting
      that he knew more about this than she did, and that his remarks applied to
      drawing-teachers as well as to all other arts and professions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main question, of course, was as to their attitude towards Harry
      Stuart when he returned. Corydon, it became clear, had forgiven him; the
      phraseology of his letter was touching, and he was now invested in the
      glamor of penitence. She insisted that the episode might be overlooked,
      and that their friendship could go on as before. But Thyrsis argued
      vigorously that their relationship could never be the same again, and
      declared that they ought not to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," Corydon protested, "he'll be at the Jennings! And I can't snub
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does Delia think about it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" Corydon exclaimed. "I haven't told Delia a word of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't told her! But why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because she'd be horrified. She'd never speak to Harry Stuart again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then you want <i>me</i> to speak to him! And even to be cordial to
      him! You want to go ahead and carry on a sentimental flirtation with him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Thyrsis!" she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's what it would come to. And how much peace of mind do you
      suppose I'd have, while I knew that was going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At which Corydon sighed pathetically. "I'm a fine sort of emancipated
      woman!" she said. "Don't you see you're playing the role of the
      conventional jealous husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she thought over the matter in the privacy of her own mind she was
      filled with perplexity, and wondered at herself. She found herself
      actually longing to see Harry Stuart. She asked herself, "Can it really be
      I, Corydon, who am capable of being interested in any other man besides my
      husband?" She could not bring herself to face the fact that it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. Thyrsis went away, and took to wandering about the country,
      wrestling with his new book. After the fashion of every work that came to
      possess him, it seemed to possess him as no other work had ever done
      before. His mind was in a turmoil with it, his thoughts racing from one
      part to another; he would stop in the midst of pumping a bucket of water
      or bringing in a supply of wood, to jot down some notes that came to him.
      Each day he realized more fully the nature of the task. Seated alone at
      night in his tiny cabin, his spirit would cry out in terror at the burden
      that had been heaped upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had decided upon the title of the book&mdash;"Art and Money: an Essay
      in the Economic Interpretation of Literature". And then, late one night,
      as he was pondering it, there had flashed over him the form into which he
      should cast the work; he would make it, not only an exposition of his
      philosophy, but the story of his life, the cry of his soul. There had come
      to him an introductory statement; it was a smashing thing&mdash;a thing
      that would arrest and stun! Disraeli had said that a critic was a man who
      had failed as a creative writer; and Thyrsis would take that taunt and
      make it into his battle-cry. "I who write this," he would say&mdash;"I am
      a failure; I am a murdered artist! I sit by the corpse of my dead dreams,
      I dip my pen into the heart's blood of my strangled vision!" So he would
      indict the forces that had murdered him, and through the rest of the book
      he would pursue them&mdash;he would track them to their lair and corner
      them, and slay them with a sharp sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Delia Gordon had gone back to her studies, and Corydon had
      settled down to her lonely task. She washed and dressed and fed the baby,
      and satisfied what she could of his insatiable demands for play. Thyrsis
      would come and help to get the meals and wash the dishes; but even then he
      was poor company&mdash;he was either tired out, or lost in thought, and
      his nerves were in such a state that he could not bear to be criticized.
      It was getting to be harder for him to endure the strain of hearing
      complaints; and so Corydon shrunk more and more into herself, and took to
      pouring out her soul in long letters and journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," she wrote to Delia, "that to some people life is a
      continuous expiation&mdash;an expiation of submerged hereditary sins, as
      well as of conscious ones? A great deal of the time life seems to me a
      hopeless puzzle; I am so utterly unfitted for the roles I labor to play.
      Is it that I am too low for my environment? Or can it be that I am too
      high? Surely there must some day be other things that women can do in the
      world besides training children. I try to love my task, but I have no
      talent for it, and it is a frightful strain upon me. After one hour of
      blocks and choo-choo cars, I am perfectly prostrated. I have been cheated
      out of the joys of motherhood, that is the truth&mdash;the spring was
      poisoned for me at the very beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not mind my lamentations, dear Delia," she wrote in another
      letter. "You can't imagine how lonely my life is&mdash;no, for it is
      different when you are here. Oh, I am so weary! so weary! It didn't use to
      be like this. Every moment of leisure I had I would run and try to study;
      I would read something&mdash;I was always eager and hungry. But now I am
      dull&mdash;I do not follow my inspirations. If only Thyrsis and I might
      sometimes read together! I love to be read to, but he cannot bear it&mdash;he
      reads three times as fast to himself, he says. He will do it if I am sick;
      but even then it makes him nervous, and I cannot help but know that,
      however he tries to hide it. It is one of our troubles, but we know each
      other's states of mind intuitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Delia, was there ever a tragedy in the world like that of our love?
      (Almost everything in our lives is pain, and so we are coming to stand for
      pain to each other!) I ask myself sometimes if any two people who love
      could stand what we have to stand. Sometimes I think they could, if their
      love was different; but then that thought breaks my heart! Why cannot our
      love be different, I ask!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had one of my frightful fits of unhappiness to-day. It was nothing&mdash;it
      was my fault, I guess. I am very sensitive. But I think it is a tendency
      of Thyrsis' temperament to try instinctively to overcome mine. Apparently
      the only thing that will conquer him is seeing me suffer; then he will
      give way&mdash;he will promise anything I want, blame himself for his
      rigidity, scourge himself for his blindness, do anything at all I ask. So
      I tell myself, everything will be different now; the last problem is
      solved! I see how good and kind he is, how noble his impulses are; he has
      never failed me in the big things of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose Mr. Harding writes you about us. He was up here this afternoon.
      He was very gentle and kind to me; he talked about his religion. Did you
      tell him much about me? It is a singular thing, how he seems to understand
      without being told. I realized to-day that whenever we talk about my life,
      we take everything for granted. Also, it seems strange that he does not
      blame me; generally people who are conventional think that I am selfish,
      that I ought to be loving my baby, instead of struggling with my pitiful
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wrote a little stanza the other night, dear Delia. Doesn't it seem
      strange, that when I am at the last gasp with agony, I should find myself
      thinking of lines of poetry? I called it 'Life'; you will say that it is
      too sombre&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A lonely journey in a night of storm, Lighted by flashes of inconstant
      faith, Goaded by multitudes of vague desires, And mocked by phantoms of
      remote delight!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. Just at this time Corydon found herself the victim of backaches
      and fits of exhaustion, for which there was no cause to be discovered.
      Each attack meant that Thyrsis would have to drop his work, and come and
      be housekeeper and nurse; he would have to repress every slightest sign of
      the impatience, which, was burning him up&mdash;knowing that if he gave
      vent to it, he would drive Corydon half-wild with suffering. After two or
      three such crises, he made up his mind that it was impossible for him to
      go on, until there was some one to help her in these emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of their farm-hunting expeditions, they had in mind a place
      which was a compromise between their different requirements. It had a good
      barn and plenty of fruit, and at the same time a view, and a house with
      comfortable rooms, and wall-paper that was not altogether unendurable. It
      was offered for four thousand dollars, of which nearly three-quarters
      might remain upon mortgage; so they had agreed that their future happiness
      would depend upon the war-book's bringing them in a thousand dollars.
      Since this hope had failed, he had applied to Darrell, and to Paret, but
      neither of them had the money to spare. It now fell out, that just as he
      was at the point of desperation, he received a letter from the clergyman
      who had married them, Dr. Hamilton. This worthy man had been reading
      Thyrsis' manuscripts and following his career; and he now wrote to tell
      how greatly he had been impressed by the new novel. Whereupon the author
      was seized by a sudden resolve, and packed up a hand-satchel and set out
      for the city, with all the forces of his being nerved for an assault upon
      this ill-fated clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hamilton sat in his little office, looking pale and worn, his face
      deeply seamed with lines of care. As the poet thought of it in later
      years, he realized that this man's function in life was to be a
      clearing-house for human misery&mdash;the wrecks of the competitive system
      in all classes and grades of society came to him to pour out their
      troubles and beg for help. It was not so very long afterwards that he went
      to pieces from overwork and nervous strain; and Thyrsis wondered with a
      guilty feeling how much his own assault had contributed to this result.
      Assuredly it could not happen often that a clergyman had to listen to a
      more harrowing tale than this "murdered artist" had to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor heard it out, and then began to argue: like the philanthropist
      in Boston, he was greatly troubled by the fear of "weakening the springs
      of character". Being an "advanced" clergyman, he was familiar with the pat
      phrases of evolutionary science&mdash;his mind was a queer jumble of the
      philosophy of Herbert Spencer and that of Thomas à Kempis. But Thyrsis
      just now was in a mood which might have moved even Spencer himself; he was
      almost frantic because of Corydon, whom he had left half-ill at home. He
      was not pleading for himself, he said&mdash;he could always get along; but
      oh, the horror of having to kill his wife for the sake of his books! To
      have to sit by day by day and watch her dying! He told about that night
      when Corydon had tried to kill herself; and now another winter was upon
      them, and he knew that unless something were done, the spring-time would
      not find her alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suicide story turned the balance with the clergyman; Herbert Spencer
      was put back upon the shelf, and Thomas à Kempis ruled the day. Dr.
      Hamilton said that he would see one of his rich parishioners, and persuade
      him to take a second mortgage on the farm. And so Thyrsis went back, a
      messenger of wondrous tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later came the check. The deed had been got ready; and Thyrsis
      drove to the farm, and carried off the farmer and his wife to the nearest
      notary-public. The old man pleaded to stay in his home until the new year,
      but Thyrsis was obdurate, allowing him only a week in which to get himself
      and his belongings to another place. And meantime he and Corydon were
      packing up. They drove to another "vandew", and purchased more odds and
      ends of household stuff; and Thyrsis had his little study loaded upon a
      wagon, and taken to the new place.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wonderful adventure was this moving! To enter a real house, with two
      stories, and two pairs of stairs, and eight rooms, and a cellar, and
      regular plastered walls, and no end of closets and shelves and such-like
      domestic luxuries! To be able to set apart a whole room in which the baby
      might spread himself with his toys and marbles and dolls and picture-books&mdash;and
      without any one's having to stumble over them, and break their owner's
      heart! To have a real parlor, with a stove to sit by, and a table for a
      lamp, and shelves for books; and yet another room to eat in, and another
      to cook in! To be able to have a woman come to wash the dishes without
      making a bosom friend of her, and having her hear all the conversation! To
      be able to walk through fields and orchards and woodland, and know that
      they belonged to one's self, and would some day shed their coat of snow
      and blossom into new life! Thyrsis wished that he could have the book out
      of his mind for a month, so that he might be properly thrilled by this
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the Christmas season, and therefore an appropriate times for
      celebrating. He went down into the "wood-lot"&mdash;their own "wood-lot"&mdash;and
      cut a spruce tree, and set it up in the dining-room; they hung thereon all
      the contrivances which the associated grandparents had sent down to
      commemorate an occasion which was not only Christmas and house-warming,
      but the baby's third birthday as well. Because of the triple conjunction,
      they invested in a fat goose, to be roasted in the new kitchen-range; and
      besides this there were some spare-ribs and home-made sausages with which
      a neighbor had tempted them. It was a regular storybook Christmas, with a
      snow-storm raging outside, and the wind howling down the chimney, and an
      odor of molasses-taffy pervading the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. After which festivities Thyrsis bid farewell to his family once
      more, and went away to wrestle with his angel. Weeks of failure and
      struggle it cost him before he could get back what he had lost&mdash;before
      he could recall those phrases that had once blazed white-hot in his brain,
      and could see again the whole gigantic form and figure of his undertaking.
      Many an hour he spent pacing his little eight-foot piazza&mdash;four steps
      and a half each way, back and forth; many a night he would sit before his
      little fourteen-inch stove, so lost in his meditations that the stove
      would lose its red-hot glow, and the icy gale which raged outside and
      rattled the door would steal in through the cracks and set him to
      shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times he would trudge through the snow and mud to the town, spending
      the day in the library, and then bringing out an armful of books to last
      him through the night. Thyrsis had read pretty thoroughly the literature
      of the six languages he knew; but now&mdash;this was the appalling nature
      of his task&mdash;he had to go back and read it over again. He did not
      realize, until he got actually at the work, what an utter overturning
      there would be in all his ideas. How strange it was to return and read the
      "classics" of one's youth! What oceans of futility one discovered, what
      mountains of pretense&mdash;and with what forests of scholarship grown
      over them! It seemed to Thyrsis that everywhere he turned the search-light
      of his new truth, the structure of his opinions would topple like a house
      of cards. Truly, here was a <i>"Götzendämmerung"</i>, an <i>"Umwertung
      aller Werthe"!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it was that he had to read, not only literature, but also
      history&mdash;often his own kind of history, that had not yet been
      written. If he wished to know the Shakespearean dramas as a product of the
      aristocratic and imperialist ideal in the glory and intoxication of its
      youth, he had to study, not only Shakespeare's poetry, but the cultural
      and social life of the Elizabethan people. And he could not take any man's
      word for the truth; he had to know for himself. The thing that would avail
      him in this battle was not eloquence and fervor, not the flashes of his
      irony and the white-hot shafts of his scorn. What he must have were facts,
      and more facts&mdash;and then again facts!
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts were there, to be had for the gathering. Thyrsis again could
      only compare himself to Aladdin in his palace. Could it be believed that
      so many ideas had been left for one man to discover? It seemed to him,
      that the kingdoms of literature lay at his mercy; he was like a magician
      who has discovered a new spell, which places his rivals in his power. He
      knew that this book, if he could ever finish it, would alter the aspect of
      literary criticism, as a blow changes the pattern in a kaleidoscope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis had failed many times before, but this time he felt that success
      was in his hands; he knew the bookworld now, he was master of the game.
      This would set them to thinking, this would stir them up! He had got under
      the armor of his enemy at last, and he could feel him wince and writhe at
      each thrust that he drove home. So he wrought at his task, in a state of
      tense excitement, living always in imagination in the midst of the battle,
      following stroke with stroke and driving a rout before him.&mdash;So he
      would be for weeks; and then would come the reaction, when he fell back
      exhausted, and realized that his victory was mere phantasy, that nothing
      of it really counted until he had completed his labor. And that would take
      two years! Two years!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. From visions such as this Thyrsis came back to wrestle with all
      the problems of a household; with pumps that froze and drains that
      clogged, with stoves that went out and ashes that spilled, with milk-boys
      that were late and kitchen-maids that were snow-bound. He would leave his
      work at one or two o'clock in the morning, and make his way through the
      snow and the storm to the house, and crawl into bed, and then take his
      chances of being awakened by the baby, or by some spell of agony with
      Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might not sleep alone; that supreme symbol of domesticity Corydon could
      not give up, and he soon ceased to ask for it. It seemed such a little
      thing to yield; and yet it meant so much to him! The room where he slept
      came to seem to him a chamber of terror, a place to which he went "like
      the galley-slave at night, scourged to his dungeon". It was a place where
      a crime was enacted; where the vital forces of his being were squandered,
      and the body and soul of him were wrung and squeezed dry like a sponge.
      This was marriage&mdash;it was the essence of marriage; it was the slavery
      into which he had delivered himself, the duty to which he was bound. And
      in how many millions of homes was this same thing going on&mdash;this
      licensed preying of one personality upon another? And the nightmare thing
      was upheld and buttressed by all the forces of society&mdash;priests were
      saying blessings over it and moralists were singing the praises of it&mdash;"the
      holy bonds of matrimony", it was called!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all the worse to Thyrsis because there was that in him which
      welcomed this animal intimacy. So he saw that day by day their lives were
      slipping to a lower plane; day by day they were discovering new weaknesses
      and developing new vices in themselves. Corydon was now a good part of the
      time in pain of some sort; and the doctors had accustomed her to stave off
      these crises with various kinds of drugs, so that she had a set of shelves
      crowded with pills and powders and bottles. She had learned to rely upon
      them in emergencies, to plead for them when she was helpless; and so
      Thyrsis saw her declining into an inferno. He would argue with her and
      plead with her and fight with her; he would spend days trying to open her
      eyes to the peril, to show her that it was better to suffer pain than to
      resort to these treacherous aids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. They still had their hours of enthusiasm, of course, their
      illuminations and their resolutions. During the summer, while browsing
      among the English magazines in the library, Thyrsis had stumbled upon an
      astonishing article dealing with the subject of health. He read it in a
      state of great excitement, and then took it home and read it to Corydon.
      It told of the achievements of a gentleman by the name of Horace Fletcher,
      who had once possessed robust health, and lost it through careless living,
      and had then restored it by a new system of eating. To Thyrsis this came
      as one of the great discoveries of his life. For years every instinct of
      his nature had been whispering to him that his ways of eating were
      vicious; but he had been ignorant and helpless&mdash;and with all the
      world that he knew in opposition to him. As he read the article, he
      recalled a talk he had had with his "family doctor", way back before his
      marriage, when he had first begun to notice symptoms of stomach-trouble.
      He had suggested timidly that there might be something wrong with his
      diet, and that if the doctor would tell him exactly what he ought to eat,
      and how much and how often, he would be glad to adopt the regimen. But the
      doctor had only laughed and answered, "Nonsense, boy&mdash;don't you get
      to thinking about your food!" And so Thyrsis had gone away, to follow the
      old plan of eating what he liked. Health, it would seem, must be a
      spontaneous and accidental thing, it could not be a deliberate and
      reasoned thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he and Corydon became smitten with a passion of shame for all
      their stupidity and their gluttony; they invested in Fletcher's books, and
      set out upon this new adventure. They would help themselves to a very
      small saucerful of food; and they would take of this a very small spoonful&mdash;and
      chew&mdash;and chew&mdash;and chew. Mr. Fletcher said that half an hour a
      day was enough for the eating of the food one needed; but they,
      apparently, could have chewed for hours, and still been hungry. They
      labored religiously to stop as soon as they could pretend to be satisfied;
      the result of which was that Thyrsis lost fourteen pounds in as many days&mdash;and
      it was many a long year before he got those fourteen pounds back! He
      became still more "spiritual" in his aspect; until finally he and Corydon
      set out for a walk one day, and coming up a hill to their home they gave
      out altogether, and first Thyrsis had to crawl up the hill and get
      something to eat, and then take something down to Corydon!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in spite of all their blunders, this new idea was of genuine
      benefit to them; at least it put them upon the right track&mdash;it taught
      them the relationship between diet and disease. They saw the two as cause
      and consequence&mdash;they watched the food they ate affecting their
      bodies as one might watch a match affecting a thermometer. They were no
      longer victims of the idea that health must be a spontaneous and
      accidental thing&mdash;they were set definitely to thinking about it, as
      something that could be achieved by will and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the right knowledge lay far in the future; and meantime they were
      groping in ignorance, and disease was still a mysterious visitation that
      came upon them out of the night. "Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will
      I go out into the midst of Egypt; and all the firstborn in the land of
      Egypt shall die. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
      Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their own firstborn had low been on the <i>regime</i> of the "child
      specialist" for a year and a half. He was big and fat and rosy, and
      according to all the standards they knew, a picture of health. He was the
      pride of his parents' hearts&mdash;the one success they had achieved, and
      to which they could turn their eyes. He was a frightful burden to them&mdash;the
      most noisy and irrepressible of children. But they struggled and worried
      along with him, and were proud of him&mdash;and even, in a stormy sort of
      way, were happy with him. But now a calamity fell upon him, bringing them
      the most terrible distress they had yet had to face in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. It was all the worse because they laid the blame upon themselves.
      They were accustomed to attribute sickness to this or that trivial cause&mdash;if
      Corydon caught a cold, it was because she had sat in a draught, and if
      Thyrsis was laid up with tonsilitis, it was because he had gone out for
      kindling-wood without his hat. It had been their wont to bundle the child
      up and turn him out to play; and one very cold day he had stood a long
      time under the woodshed, and had got chilled. So that night his head was
      hot, and he was fretful; and in the morning he would not eat, and
      apparently had a fever. They sent off in haste for the doctor; and the
      doctor came and examined him, and shook his head and looked very grave. It
      was pneumonia, he said, and a serious case.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Corydon and Thyrsis had to put all things else aside, and gird
      themselves for a siege. There were medicines to be administered every
      hour, and minute precautions to be taken to keep the patient from the
      slightest chill; he must be in a warm room, and yet with some ventilation.
      All these things they attended to, and then they would sit and gaze at the
      sufferer, dumb with grief and fear. Through the night Thyrsis sat by the
      bedside, while Cedric babbled and raved in delirium; and no suffering that
      he had ever experienced was equal to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he loved this baby, how passionately, how cruelly! How he clung to
      him, blindly and desperately&mdash;the thought of losing him simply tore
      his heart to pieces! He would hold the hot hands, he would touch the
      little body; how he loved that body, that was so beautiful and soft and
      white! How many times he had bathed it and dressed it and hugged it to
      him! He would sit and listen to the fevered prattle, full of childish
      phrases which brought before him the childish soul&mdash;the wonderful,
      lovable thing, so merry and eager, so full of mischief and curiosity; with
      strange impulses of tenderness, and flashes of intelligence that thrilled
      one, and opened long vistas to the imagination. He was all they had, this
      baby&mdash;he was all they had saved out of the ruin of their lives, out
      of the shipwreck of their love. What sacrifices they had made for him&mdash;what
      agonies he represented! And now, the idea that they might never see him,
      nor touch him, nor hear his voice again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also would come agonies of remorse. Thyrsis would face the blunder they
      had made&mdash;it might have been avoided so easily, and now it was
      irrevocable! His whole body would shake with silent sobbing. Ah, this
      curse of their lives, this hideous shame&mdash;that they had not even been
      able to take proper care of their child! This wrong, too, the world meant
      to inflict upon them&mdash;this supreme vengeance, this cruel punishment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. The doctor came next morning, and found the patient worse. This
      was the crisis, he said; if the little one lived through the night&mdash;And
      there he paused, seeing the agony in the eyes of the mother and father.
      They would do all they could, he said; they must hope for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the siege went on. Thyrsis sat through the night again&mdash;and
      Corydon, who could not rest either, would come into the room every little
      while, and listen and watch. They would hold each other's hand for hours,
      dumb with suffering; ghostly presences seemed to haunt the sick-chamber
      and set them to trembling. Thyrsis found himself thinking of that most
      terrible of all ballads, "The Erl-King". How he had shuddered once,
      hearing it sung!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dem Vater grauset's, er reitet geschwind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the night he seemed to hear the hammer-strokes of the horse's
      hoofs echoing through his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child lived through the night, but the crisis was not yet over. The
      fever held on; the issue of life and death seemed to hang upon the flutter
      of an eyelid. There was one more night to be sat through and Thyrsis,
      whose restless intellect must needs be dealing with all issues, had by
      then fought his way through this terror also. They must get control of
      themselves at all hazards, he said; they must face the facts. If so the
      child should die&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to say something of the sort to Corydon, seeking to steady her.
      But Corydon became almost frantic at his words. "You must not say such a
      thing, you must not think such a thing!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon had been reading about "new thought", and she insisted that would
      be "holding the idea" of death over the child. "The thing for us to do,"
      she said, "is to make up our minds&mdash;he must live, we must <i>know</i>
      that he will live!"&mdash;It was no time to argue about metaphysics, but
      Thyrsis found this proposition a source of great perplexity. How could a
      man make himself know what he did not know?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis passed, and the child lived. But the illness continued for a
      couple of weeks&mdash;and how pitiful it was to see their baby, that had
      been so big and rosy, and was now pale and thin and weak! And when at last
      he got up and went outdoors again, he caught a cold, and there was a
      relapse, and another siege of the dread disease; the doctor had not warned
      them sufficiently, it seemed. So there was a week or two more of watching
      and worrying; and then they had to face the fact that little Cedric would
      be delicate for a long while&mdash;would need to be guarded with care all
      through the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis blamed himself for all that had happened; the weight of it rested
      upon him forever afterwards, as if it were some crime he had committed.
      Sometimes when he was overwrought and overdriven, he would lie awake in
      the small hours of the morning, and this spectre would come and sit by
      him. He had made a martyr of the child he loved, he had sacrificed it to
      what he called his art; and how had he dared to do it?

    <p>
      It was hard to think of a more cruel question to put to a man. Himself, no
      doubt, he might scourge and drive and wreck; but this child&mdash;what
      were the child's rights? Thyrsis would try to weigh them against the
      claims of posterity. What his own work might be, he knew; and to what
      extent should he sacrifice it to the unknown possibilities of his son?
      Some sacrifice there had to be&mdash;such was the stern decree of the
      "economic screw."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis once more was a field of warring motives; once more he faced
      the curse of his life&mdash;that he could not be as other men, he could
      not have other men's virtues. It was the latest aspect, and the most
      tragic, of that impulse in him which had made him fight so hard against
      marriage; which had made him quote to Corydon the lines of the outlaw's
      song&mdash;

      hill again, and watched the color spreading. </i>

      "We must go," she was saying. "But it was worthwhile to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was all worth-while," he said&mdash;"all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she smiled, and quoted some lines from the poem&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast bound;
        Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour!
            Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,
        If men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee power,
            If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Section 1. This illness of the baby's had been a fearful drain upon their
      strength; and Thyrsis perceived that they had now got to a point where
      they could no longer stand alone. There must be a servant in the house, to
      help Corydon, and do for the baby what had to be done. It was a hard
      decision for him to face, for his money was almost gone, and the book
      loomed larger than ever. But there was no escaping the necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would get a married couple, they decided&mdash;the man could pay for
      himself by working the farm. So they put an advertisement in a city paper,
      and perused the scores of mis-spelled replies. After due correspondence,
      and much consultation, they decided upon Patrick and Mary Flanagan; and
      Thyrsis hired a two-seated carriage and drove in to meet them at the
      depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very funny; years afterwards, when the clouds of tragedy were
      dispersed, they were able to laugh over the situation. Thyrsis had been
      used to servants in boyhood, but that was before he had acquired any ideas
      as to universal brotherhood and the rights of man. Now he hated all the
      symbols and symptoms of mastership; he shrunk from any sort of clash with
      unlovely personalities&mdash;he would be courteous and deprecating to the
      very tramp who came to his door to beg. And here were Patrick and Mary,
      very Irish, enormously stout, and devotedly Roman Catholic, having spent
      all their lives as caretakers of "gentlemen's country-places". They had
      most precise ideas as to what gentlemen's country-places should be, and
      how they should be equipped, and how the gentlemen of the country-places
      should treat their servants. And needless to say, they found nothing in
      this new situation which met with their approval. There were signs of
      humiliating poverty everywhere, and the farm-outfit was inadequate. As to
      the master and mistress, they must have been puzzling phenomena for
      Patrick and Mary to make up their minds about&mdash;possessing so many of
      the attributes of the lady and gentleman, and yet being lacking in so many
      others!
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was a precise and particular person; he wanted his work laid out
      just so, and then he would do it without interference. As for Mary&mdash;he
      stood in awe of Mary himself, and so he accepted the idea that Corydon and
      Thyrsis should stand in awe of her too. Mary it was who announced that
      their dietary was inadequate; she took no stock at all in Fletcher and
      Chittenden&mdash;she knew that working-people must have meat at least four
      times a week. Also Mary maintained that their room was not large enough
      for so stout a couple. Also she arranged it that Corydon and Thyrsis
      should get the dinner on Sundays&mdash;the Roman Catholic church being
      five miles away, and the hour of mass being late, and the horse very old
      and slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two months Corydon and Thyrsis struggled along under the dark and
      terrible shadow of the disapproval of the Flanagan family. Then one day
      there came a violent crisis between Corydon and Mary&mdash;occasioned by a
      discussion of the effect of an excess of grease upon the digestibility of
      potato-starch. Corydon fled in tears to her husband, who started for the
      kitchen forthwith, meaning to dispose of the Flanagans; when, to his vast
      astonishment, Corydon experienced one of her surges of energy, and thrust
      him to one side, and striding out upon the field of combat, proceeded to
      deliver herself of her pent-up sentiments. It was a discourse in the
      grandest style of tragedy, and Mary Flanagan was quite dumbfounded&mdash;apparently
      this was a "lady" after all! So the Flanagan family packed its belongings
      and departed in a chastened frame of mind; and Corydon turned to her
      spouse, her eyes still flashing, and remarked, "If only I had talked to
      her that way from the beginning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2. Then once more there was answering of advertisements, and another
      couple was spewed forth from the maw of the metropolis&mdash;"Henery and
      Bessie Dobbs", as they subscribed themselves. "Henery" proved to be the
      adult stage of the East Side "gamin"; lean and cynical, full of slang and
      humor and the odor of cigarettes. He was fresh from a "ticket-chopper's"
      job in the subway, and he knew no more about farming than Thyrsis did; but
      he put up a clever "bluff", and was so prompt with his wits that it was
      hard to find fault with him successfully. As for his wife, she had come
      out of a paper-box factory, and was as skilled at housekeeping as her
      husband was at agriculture; she was frail and consumptive, and told
      Corydon the story of her pitiful life, with the result that she was able
      to impose upon her even more than her predecessor had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henery" was slow at pitching hay and loading stone, but when the season
      came, he developed a genius for peddling fruit; he was always hungry for
      any sort of chance to bargain, and was forever coming upon things which
      Thyrsis ought to buy. Very quickly the neighborhood discovered this
      propensity of his, and there was a constant stream of farmers who came to
      offer second-hand buggies, and wind-broken horses, and dried-up cows, and
      patent hay-rakes and churns and corn-shellers at reduced values; all of
      which rather tended to reveal to Thyrsis the unlovely aspects of his
      neighbors, and to weaken his faith in the perfectibility of the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Henery's discoveries was a pair of aged and emaciated mules. He
      became eloquent as to how he could fatten up these mules and what crops he
      could raise in the spring. So Thyrsis bought the mules, and also a supply
      of feed; but the fattening process failed to take effect-for the reason,
      as Thyrsis finally discovered, that the mules were in need of new teeth.
      When the plowing season began, Henery at first expended a vast amount of
      energy in beating the creatures with a stick, but finally he put his
      inventive genius to work, and devised a way to drive them without beating.
      It was some time before Thyrsis noted the change; when he made inquiries,
      he learned to his consternation that the ingenious Henery had fixed up the
      stick with a pin in the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      At any time of the day one might stand upon the piazza of the house and
      gaze out across the corn-field, and see a long procession marching through
      the furrow. First there came the mules, and then came the plow, and then
      came Henery; and after Henery followed the dog, and after the dog followed
      the baby, and after the baby followed a train of chickens, foraging for
      worms. Little Cedric was apparently content to trot back and forth in the
      field for hours; which to his much-occupied parents seemed a delightful
      solution of a problem. But it happened one day when they had a visit from
      Mr. Harding, that Thyrsis and the clergyman came round the side of the
      house, and discovered the child engaged in trying to drag a heavy
      arm-chair through a door that was too small for it. He was wrestling like
      a young titan, purple in the face with rage; and shouting, in a perfect
      reproduction of Henery's voice and accent, "Come round here, God damn you,
      come round here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many such drawbacks to be balanced against the joys of "life on
      a farm". Thyrsis reflected with a bitter smile that his experiences and
      Corydon's had been calculated to destroy their illusions as to several
      kinds of romance. They had tried "Grub Street", and the poet's garret, and
      the cultivating of literature upon a little oatmeal; they had not found
      that a joyful adventure. They had tried the gypsy style of existence; they
      had gone back "to the bosom of nature"&mdash;and had found it a cold and
      stony bosom. They had tried out "love in a cottage", and the
      story-writer's dream of domestic raptures. And now they were chasing
      another will o' the wisp&mdash;that of "amateur farming"! When Thyrsis had
      purchased half the old junk in the township, and had seen the mules go
      lame, and the cows break into the pear-orchard and "founder" themselves;
      when he had expended two hundred dollars' worth of money and two thousand
      dollars' worth of energy to raise one hundred dollars' worth of vegetables
      and fruit, he framed for himself the conclusion that a farm is an
      excellent place for a literary man, provided that he can be kept from
      farming it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3. As the result of such extravagances, when they had got as far as
      the month of February, Thyrsis' bank-account had sunk to almost nothing.
      However, he had been getting ready for this emergency; he had prepared a
      <i>scenario</i> of his new book, setting forth the ideas it would contain
      and the form which it would take. This he sent to his publisher, with a
      letter saying that he wanted the same contract and the same advance as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again he waited in breathless suspense. He knew that he had here a
      work of vital import, one that would be certain to make a sensation, even
      if it did not sell like a novel. It was, to be sure, a radical book&mdash;perhaps
      the most radical ever published in America; but on the other hand, it
      dealt with questions of literature and philosophy, where occasionally even
      respectable and conservative reviews permitted themselves to dally with
      ideas. Thyrsis was hoping that the publisher might see prestige and
      publicity in the adventure, and decide to take a chance; when this proved
      to be the case, he sank back with a vast sigh of relief. He had now money
      enough to last until midsummer, and by that time the book would be more
      than half done&mdash;and also the farm would be paying.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, it seemed with them that strokes of calamity always followed
      upon strokes of good fortune. At this time Corydon's ailments became
      acute, and her nervous crises were no longer to be borne. There were
      anxious consultations on the subject, and finally it was decided that she
      should consult another "specialist". This was an uncle of Mr. Harding's, a
      man of most unusual character, the clergyman declared; the latter was
      going to the city, and would be glad to introduce Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a couple of days later came to Thyrsis a letter, conveying the tidings
      that she was discovered to be suffering from an abdominal tumor, and
      should undergo an immediate operation. It would cost a hundred dollars,
      and the hospital expenses would be at least as much; which meant that,
      with the bill-paying that had already taken place, their money would all
      be gone at the outset!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thyrsis did not waste any time in lamenting the inevitable. He was
      rather glad of the tidings, on the whole&mdash;at least there was a
      definite cause for Corydon's suffering, and a prospect of an end to it.
      Both of them had still their touching faith in doctors and surgeons, as
      speaking with final and godlike authority upon matters beyond the
      comprehension of the ordinary mind. The operation would not be dangerous,
      Corydon wrote, and it would make a new woman of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only have Delia Gordon with me," she added, "then my happiness
      would be complete. Only think of it, she left for Africa last week! I know
      she would have waited, if she'd known about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, I shall make out. Mr. Harding is going to be in town for more
      than a week&mdash;he is attending a conference of some sort, and he has
      promised to come and see me in the hospital. I think he likes to do such
      things&mdash;he has the queerest professional air about it, so that you
      feel you are being sympathized with for the glory of God. But really he is
      very beautiful and good, and I think you have never appreciated him. I am
      happy to-day, almost exhilarated; I feel as if I were about to escape from
      a dungeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4. Such was the mood in which she went to her strange experience.
      She liked the hospital-room, tiny, but immaculately clean; she liked the
      nurses, who seemed to her to be altogether superior and exemplary beings&mdash;moving
      with such silence and assurance about their various tasks. She slept
      soundly, and in the morning they combed and plaited her hair and prepared
      her for the ceremony. There came a bunch of roses to her room, with a card
      from Mr. Harding; and these were exquisite, and made her happy, so that,
      when the doctor arrived, she went almost gaily to the operating-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything there aroused her curiosity; the pure white walls and ceiling,
      shining with matchless cleanness, the glittering instruments arranged
      carefully on glass tables, the attentive and pleasant-faced nurses,
      standing also in pure white, and the doctor in his vestments, smiling
      reassuringly. In the centre of the room was a large glass table, long
      enough for a reclining body, and through the sky-light the sun poured a
      pleasing radiance over all. "How beautiful!" exclaimed Corydon; and the
      nurses exchanged glances, and the old doctor failed to hide an expression
      of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish all my patients felt like that," said he. "Now climb up on the
      table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon promptly did so, and another doctor who was to administer the
      anaesthetic came to her side. "Take a very deep breath, please," he said,
      as he placed over her mouth a white, cone-shaped thing that had a rather
      suffocating odor. Corydon was obedience itself, and breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment her body seemed to be falling from her. "Oh, I don't like it!"
      she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Breathe deeply, and count as far as you can," came a voice from far above
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" whispered Corydon. "Oh, I don't want&mdash;I want to come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to count&mdash;or rather some strange voice, not hers,
      seemed to count for her; as the first numbness passed, farther and farther
      away she seemed to dissolve, to become a disembodied consciousness poised
      in a misty ether. And at that moment&mdash;so she told Thyrsis afterwards&mdash;the
      face of Mr. Harding seemed to appear just above her, and to look at her
      with a pained and startled expression. It was a beautiful face, she
      thought; and she knew that everything she felt was being immediately
      registered in Mr. Harding's mind. They were two affinitized beings,
      suspended in the centre of a cosmos; "their soul intelligences were all
      that had been left of the sentient world after some cataclysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always knew that about us," thought Corydon, and she realized that the
      face before her understood, even though at the moment it, too, was
      dissolving. "I wonder why"&mdash;she mused&mdash;"why&mdash;" And then the
      little spark went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later the doctor was bending over her, anxiously scrutinizing
      her passive face. "Nurse, bring me some ice-water," he was saying. "She
      takes her time coming to." And sharply he struck her cheek and forehead
      with his finger-tips; but she showed no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep down in some mysterious inner chamber, beneath the calm face, there
      was being enacted a grim spirit-drama. Corydon's soul was making a
      monstrous effort to return to its habitation; Corydon felt herself
      hanging, a tortured speck of being, in a dark and illimitable void. "This
      may be Hell," she thought. "I have neither hands nor feet, and I cannot
      fight; but I can <i>will</i> to get back!" This effort cost her
      inexpressible agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange incessant throbbing was going on in the black pit over which she
      seemed suspended. It had a kind of rhythm&mdash;metallic, and yet with a
      human resonance. It began way down somewhere, and proceeded with maddening
      accuracy to ascend through the semi-tones of a gigantic scale. Each beat
      was agony to her; it ascended to a certain pitch in merciless crescendo,
      then fell to the bottom again, and began anew its swift, maddeningly
      accurate ascent. Each time it ascended a little higher, and always
      straining her endurance to the uttermost, and bringing a more vivid
      realization of agony. "Will you stop here," it seemed to pulsate. "No, no,
      I will go on," willed Corydon. "You shall not keep me, I must escape, I
      must <i>get out</i>." But it kept up incessantly, ruthlessly, its strange,
      formless, soundless din, until the spirit writhed in its grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally it seemed to Corydon that she was getting nearer&mdash;nearer to
      something, she knew not what. The blackness about her seemed to condense,
      and she found herself in what was apparently the middle of a lake, and
      some dark bodies with arms were trying to drag her down. "No, no," she
      willed to these forms, "you <i>shall</i> not. I do not belong here, I
      belong up&mdash;up!" And by a violent effort she escaped&mdash;into
      sensations yet more agonizing, more acute. The vibrations were getting
      faster and faster, whirling her along, stretching her consciousness to
      pieces. "Will it never end?" she thought. "Have mercy!" But after an
      eternity of such repetition, she found a bright light staring at her, and
      a frightful sense of heaviness, like mountains piled upon her. Also,
      eating her up from head to foot, was a strange, unusual pain; yes, it must
      be pain, though she had never felt anything like it before. She moaned;
      and there came a spasm of nausea, that seemed to tear her asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was standing by her. "She gave me quite a fright," he was
      saying. "There, that's it, nurse. She'll be sleeping sweetly in a minute."
      The nurse hurried forward, and Corydon felt a stinging sensation in her
      side, and then a delightful numbness crept over her. "Oh, thank you,
      doctor," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5. The next week held for Corydon continuous suffering, which she
      bore with a rebellious defiance&mdash;feeling that she had been betrayed
      in some way. "If you had only told me," she wailed, to the doctor. "I
      would rather have stayed as I was before!" For answer he would pat her
      cheek and tell her to go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days dragged on. Every afternoon her mother came and read to her for
      several hours; and in the afternoons Mr. Harding would come, and sit by
      her bedside in his kind way and talk to her. Sometimes he only stayed a
      few minutes, but often he would spend an hour or so, trying to dispel the
      clouds of gloom and despondency that were hanging over her. Corydon told
      him of her vision in the operating-room, and strange to say he declared
      that he had known it all; also he said that he had helped her to fight her
      way back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to understand her every need, and from his sympathy gave her all
      the comfort he could. But he little realized all that it meant to her&mdash;how
      deeply it stirred her gratitude and her liking for him. During the day she
      would find herself counting the hours until the time he had named; and
      when the expected knock would come, and his tall figure appear at the
      door, her heart would give a sudden jump and send the blood rushing to her
      head. Her lips would tremble slightly as she held out her hand to him; and
      as he sat and looked at her, she would become uncomfortably conscious of
      the beating of her heart; in fact at times it would almost suffocate her,
      and her cheeks would become as fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if he noticed it. But he seemed concerned only for her
      welfare, and anxiously inquired how she felt. She was not doing well, it
      seemed, and the doctor was greatly troubled; her temperature had not
      become normal since the operation, and they could not account for it, as
      she was suffering no more than the usual amount of pain. To Corydon this
      was a matter of no importance; she was willing to lie there all day, if
      only the hour of Mr. Harding's visit would come more quickly. She was
      beginning to be alarmed because she had such difficulty in controlling her
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic hour would strike, and the door of hope open, and there upon the
      threshold he would appear, in all his superb manhood. Corydon thought she
      had never before met a man who gave her such an impression of vitality. He
      was splendid; he was like a young Viking, who brought into the room with
      him the pure air of the Northern mountains. When he looked at her, his
      eyes assumed a wonderful expression, a "golden" expression, as Corydon
      described it to herself. And day after day she clothed this Viking in more
      lustrous garments, woven from the threads of her imagination, her
      innermost desires and her dreams. And always at sight of him, her heart
      beat faster, her head became hotter; until the bed she lay upon became a
      bed of burning coals. She realized at last what had happened to her, that
      she loved&mdash;yes, that she loved! But she must not let her Viking see
      it; that would be unpardonable, it would damn her forever in his sight.
      And so she struggled with her secret. At night she slept in fitful starts,
      and in the morning she lay pale and sombre. But when he came she was all
      brilliancy and animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6. Each night the doctor would look anxiously at his thermometer; it
      was a source of great worry to him and to Corydon's parents that the fever
      did not abate. Also, needless to say, the news worried Thyrsis; all the
      more, because it meant a long stay in the hospital, and more of their
      money gone. At last he came up to town to see about it; and Corydon
      thought to herself, "This is very wrong of me. It is Thyrsis I ought to be
      interested in, it is his sympathy I ought to be craving."
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought the image of Thyrsis before her; it seemed vague and unreal.
      She found that she remembered mostly the unattractive aspects of him. And
      this brought a pang to her. "He is good and noble," she told herself; she
      forced herself to think of generous things that he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came; and then she felt still more ashamed. He had been working very
      hard, and was pale and haggard; it was becoming to him to be that way.
      Recollections came back to her in floods; yes, he was truly good and
      noble!
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat by her bedside, and she told him about the operation, and poured
      out the hunger of her soul to him. He stayed all the morning with her, and
      he came again and spent the afternoon with her. He read to her and kissed
      her and soothed her&mdash;his influence was very calming, she found. After
      he had gone for the night, Corydon lay thinking, "I still love him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange it was that she could love two men at once! It was surely very
      wrong! She would never have dreamed that she, Corydon, could do such a
      thing. She thought of Harry Stuart, and of the unacknowledged thrill of
      excitement which his presence had brought to her. "And now here it is
      again," she mused&mdash;"only this time it is worse! What <i>can</i>&mdash;be
      the matter with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she wondered, "Do I really love Mr. Harding? Haven't I got over it
      now?" But the least thinking of him sufficed to set her heart to thumping
      again; and so she shrunk from that train of thought. She wanted to love
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came again the next morning, and Corydon found that she was very happy
      in his presence. Her fever was slightly lower, and she thought, "I will
      get well quickly now."
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas, she had reckoned in this without Thyrsis! To sit in the hospital
      all day was a cruel strain upon him; the more so as he had been entirely
      unprepared for it. Corydon had assured him that the operation would be
      nothing, and that she would not need him; and so he had just finished a
      harrowing piece of labor on the book. Now to stay all day and witness her
      struggle, to satisfy her craving for sympathy and to meet and wrestle with
      her despair&mdash;it was like having the last drops of his soul-energy
      squeezed out of him. He did not know what was troubling Corydon, but the
      <i>rapport</i> between them was so close, that he knew she was in some
      distress of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood the ordeal as long as he could, and then he had to beg for
      respite. Cedric was down on the farm, with no one but the servants to care
      for him; so he would go back, and see that everything was all right, and
      after he had rested up for two or three days, he would come again. Corydon
      smiled faintly and assented&mdash;for that morning she had received a note
      from Mr. Harding, saying that he would be in town the next day, and would
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Thyrsis went away, and Corydon lay and thought the problem over again.
      "Yes, I love my husband; but it's such an effort for him to love me! And
      why should that be? I don't believe it would be such an effort for Mr.
      Harding to love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So again she was seized by the thought of the young clergyman. And she was
      astonished at the difference in her feelings&mdash;the flood of emotion
      that swept over her. Her heart began to beat fast and her cheeks once more
      to burn. He was coming up to the city on purpose, this time; it must be
      that he wanted to see her very much!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night was an especially hard one for her; she felt as though the
      frail shell that held her were breaking, as though her endurance were
      failing altogether. The fever had risen, and her bed had seemed like the
      burning arms of Moloch. Once she imagined that the room was stifling her,
      and in a sudden frenzy of impatience she struggled upon one elbow and
      flung her pillow across the room. In that instant she had noticed a new
      and sharp pain in her side; it did not leave her, though at the time she
      thought little about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was all absorbed in the coming of Mr. Harding; by the time morning had
      come she had made up her mind that her one hope of deliverance was in
      confession. She must tell him, she must make known to him her love; and he
      would forgive her, and then her heart would not beat so violently at sight
      of him, her fever would abate and she might rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he sat there, talking to her, and looking so beautiful and so
      strange, she trembled, and made half a dozen vain efforts to begin.
      Finally she asked, "Have you ever read that poem of Heine's&mdash;'Ein
      Jüngling liebt ein Mädchen, Die hat einen Andern erwählt?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," he answered; then they were silent again. Finally Corydon
      nerved herself to yet another effort. "Mr. Harding," she said, "will you
      come a little nearer, please. I have something very important to say to
      you." And then, waveringly and brokenly, now in agonized abashment, now
      rushing ahead as she felt his encouragement and sympathy, she gave him the
      whole story of her suffering and its cause. When she came to the words
      "because I love you", she closed her eyes and her spirit sank back with a
      great gasp of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened them again, his head was bowed in his hands and he did not
      move. "Mr. Harding," she whispered, "Mr. Harding, you forgive me, do you
      not? You do not hate me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself with an effort. "Dear child," said he, and as he looked
      at her she thought she had never seen a face so sad, so exquisite&mdash;"it
      is I who ask forgiveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and came to her bedside, and took her hand in both of his. "It
      would not be right for me to say to you what you have said to me. We must
      not speak of this any more. You will promise me this, and then you will
      rest, and to-morrow you will be better. Soon you will be well; and how
      glad your husband will be&mdash;and all of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he pressed her hand firmly, and left the room; and Corydon
      turned her face to the wall, and whispered happily to herself, "Yes, he
      loves me, he loves me! And now I shall rest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7. For a while she slept the sleep of exhaustion, nor did there fall
      across her dreams the shadow of the angel of fate who was even then
      placing his mark upon her forehead. Toward morning she was awakened
      suddenly with the sharp pain in her side; but it abated presently, and
      Corydon thought blissfully of the afternoon before. He would come again to
      her, she would see him that very day; and so what did pain matter? She was
      really happy at last. But as the day advanced, she became uneasy; her
      fever had not diminished, and the pain was becoming more persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was anxious, too. Her mother came and regarded her in alarm. But
      she was thinking of Mr. Harding. He was coming; he might arrive at any
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock upon the door. Corydon's pulse fluttered, and she
      whispered, "Here he is!" She could scarcely speak the words, "Come in".
      But when the door opened, she saw that it was the doctor. Her heart sank,
      and she closed her eyes with a moan of pain. Could it be that he was not
      coming? Could it be that she had been mistaken&mdash;that he did not love
      her after all? She must see him&mdash;she must! She could not endure this
      suspense; she could not endure these interruptions by other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came and sat by her. "I must see what is the matter here," he
      said. "Why do you not get well, Corydon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He questioned her carefully and looked grave. "I must have a consultation
      at once," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon's hand caught at his sleeve. "No, no!" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid," said the doctor. "It won't hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't that," said Corydon. She all but added, "I must see Mr.
      Harding!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wheeled into the operating-room, but this time there was no
      interest in her eyes as she regarded the smooth table and the shining
      instruments. As they lifted her upon it, she shuddered. "Oh I cannot, I
      cannot!" she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there," said the doctor. "Be brave. We wish simply to see what the
      matter is. It won't take long."
    </p>
    <p>
      And they put the cone to her mouth. Corydon struggled and gasped, but it
      was no use, she was in the clutches of the fiend again; only this time
      there was no ecstasy, and no vision of Mr. Harding. Instead there was
      instant and sickening suffocation. Again she descended into the uttermost
      depths of the inferno; and it seemed as though this time the brave will
      was not equal to the battle before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeons made their examination, and they discovered more diseased
      tissue, and a slowly spreading infection. So there was nothing for it but
      to operate again&mdash;they held a quick consultation, and then went
      ahead. And afterwards they labored and sweated, and by dint of persistent
      effort, and every device at their command, they fanned into life once more
      the faint spark in the ashen-grey form that lay before them. But it was a
      feeble flame they got; as Corydon's eyelids fluttered, the only sign of
      recognition that came from her lips was a moan, and from her eyes a look
      of dazed stupidity. But there was hope for her life, the doctors said; and
      they sent a telegram which Thyrsis got three days later, when he had
      fought his way to the town through five miles of heavy snow-drifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the grim fight for life was going on. In the morning Corydon
      opened her eyes to a burning torture, the racked and twisted nerves
      quivering in rebellion. It did not come in twinges of pain, it was a slow,
      deadening, persistent agony, that pervaded every inch of her body. She
      wondered how she could bear it, how she could live. And yet, strangely,
      inexplicably, she wanted to live. She did not know why&mdash;she had been
      outraged, she had been deserted by all, she was but a feeble atom of
      determination in the centre of a hostile universe. And yet she would pit
      her will against them all, God, man, and devil; they should not conquer
      her, she would win out.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she would clench her teeth together and fight. For hours she would
      stare at the wall, the blank, unresponsive, formless wall before her; and
      then, when the shadows of the evening fell, and they saw she was fainting
      from exhaustion, they would come with the needle of oblivion, and the
      dauntless soul would die for the night, and return in the morning to its
      pitiless task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8. Thyrsis received a couple of letters at the same time as the
      telegram, and he took the next train for the city. It is said that a
      drowning man sees before him in a few moments the panorama of his whole
      life; but to Thyrsis were given three hours in which to recall the events
      of his love for Corydon. He had every reason to believe that he would find
      her dying; and such pangs of suffering as came to him he had never known
      before. He was in a crowded car, and he would not shed a tear; but he sat,
      crouched in a heap and staring before him, fairly quivering with pent-up
      and concentrated grief. God, how he loved her! What a spirit of pure flame
      she was&mdash;what a creature from another sky! What martyrdom she had
      dared for him, and how cruelly she had been punished for her daring! And
      now, this was the end; she was dying&mdash;perhaps dead! How was he to
      live without her&mdash;in the bare and barren future that he saw
      stretching out before him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Flashes of memory would come to him, waves of torment roll over him. He
      would recall her gestures, the curves of her face, the tones of her voice,
      the songs that she had sung; and then would come a choking in his throat,
      and he would clench his hands, as a runner in the last moments of a
      desperate race. He thought of her as he had seen her last. He had gone
      away, careless and unthinking&mdash;how blind he had been! The things that
      he had not said to her, and that he might have said so easily! The love he
      had not uttered, the pardons he had not procured! The yearnings and
      consecrations that had remained unspoken all through their lives&mdash;ah
      God, what a tragedy of impotence and failure their lives had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then before his soul came troops of memories, each one a fiend with a whip
      of fire; the words of anger that he had spoken, the acts of cruelty that
      he had done! The times when he had made her weep, and had not comforted
      her! Oh, what a fool he had been&mdash;what a blind and wanton fool! And
      now&mdash;if he were to find her dead, and never be able to tell her of
      his shame and sorrow&mdash;he knew that he would carry the memories with
      him all his days, they would be like blazing scars upon his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still alive, however; and so he took a deep breath, and went at
      his task. There was no question now of what he could bear to do, but of
      what he must do; she must be saved, and who could do it but himself? Who
      else could take her hands and whisper to her, and fill her with new
      courage and hope; who else could bid her to live&mdash;to live; could
      rouse the fainting spirit, and bid it rise up and set forth upon the
      agonizing journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      So out of the very abyss they came together. But when at last the fight
      was won, when the doctors an-nounced that she was out of danger, Thyrsis
      was fairly reeling with exhaustion. When he left her in the afternoon, he
      would go to his hotel-room and lie down, utterly prostrated; he would lie
      awake the whole night through, wrestling with the demons of horror that he
      had brought with him from her bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he realized that he was on the verge of collapse, and that cost what it
      would, he must get away. Corydon's mother was with her, and when she was
      strong enough to be moved, she would be taken back to the farm. He
      mentioned this to Corydon, and she replied that she would be satisfied.
      There would be Mr. Harding also, she said; Mr. Harding wrote that he would
      come up to the city, and do what he could to help her in her dire
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9. There came from the higher regions a pass upon a steamer to
      Florida; and so Thyrsis sailed away. With a determined effort he took all
      his cares, and locked them back in a far chamber of his mind. He would not
      think about Corydon, nor about what he would do for money when he came
      home; more important yet, he would clear the book out of his thoughts&mdash;he
      would not permit it to gnaw at him all day and all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by these resolves he stood grimly. He walked the deck for hours every
      day; he watched the foaming green waters, and the gulls wheeling in the
      sky, and the sun setting over the sea, and the new moon showering its fire
      upon the waves. Gradually the air grew warm, and ice and snow became as an
      evil dream. A land of magic it seemed to which Thyrsis came&mdash;the
      beauty of it enfolded him like a clasp of love. He saw pine-forests, and
      swamps with alligators in them, and live oaks draped with trailing grey
      moss. The clumps of palmettos fascinated him&mdash;he had seen pictures of
      such trees in the tropics, and would hardly have been astonished to see a
      herd of elephants in their shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a beach, snow-white and hard, upon which he walked for uncounted
      miles. He gathered strange shells and crabs, and watched the
      turkey-buzzards on the shore, and the slow procession of the pelicans,
      sailing past above the tops of the breakers. He saw the black fins of the
      grampuses cutting the water, and thought that they were sharks. He stood
      for hours at a time up to his waist in the surf, casting for sea-bass; he
      got few fish, but joy and excitement he got in abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, back upon the hammocks&mdash;to walk upon the hard shell roads, and
      see orange and lemon-groves, and gardens filled with roses and magnolias,
      and orchards of mulberry and fig-trees. Truly this must have been the land
      which the poet had described&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Where every prospect pleases,
    And only man is vile."
</pre>
    <p>
      Thyrsis stayed in a humble boarding-house, but nearby was one of the
      famous winter-resorts of the Florida East Coast, and he was free to go
      there, and wander about the lobbies and piazzas of the palatial hotels,
      and watch the idle rich at their diversions. A strange society they were&mdash;it
      seemed as if the scum of the civilization of forty-five states had been
      blown into this bit of back-water. Here were society women, jaded with
      dissipation; stock-brokers and financiers, fleeing from the strain of the
      "Street"; here were parasites of every species, who, having nothing to do
      at home&mdash;or perhaps not even having any home&mdash;had come to this
      land of warmth to prolong their orgies. They raced over the roads and
      beaches in autos, and over the water in swift motor-boats; they dressed
      themselves half a dozen times a day, they fed themselves upon rich and
      costly foods, they gambled and gossiped and drank and wantoned their time
      away. As he watched them it was all that Thyrsis could do to keep himself
      from beginning another manifesto for the "Appeal to Reason". Oh, if only
      the toilers of the nation could be brought here, and shown what became of
      the wealth they produced!
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to complete his study of winter-resort manners and morals, Thyrsis
      encountered a college acquaintance whose father had become enormously rich
      through a mining speculation, and was here with a party of friends in a
      private-train. So he was whirled off in one of half a dozen automobiles,
      and rode for a hundred miles or so to an inland lake, and sat down to an
      <i>al fresco</i> luncheon of such delicacies as <i>paté de fois gras</i>
      and jellied grouse and champagne. Afterwards the young people wandered
      about and amused themselves, and the elders played "bridge", in the face
      of all the raptures of this wonderland of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange and sombre figure Thyrsis must have seemed to these people, with
      his brooding air and his worn clothing; he rode home in an auto with half
      a dozen youths and maidens, and while they flashed by lakes and rivers
      that gleamed in the golden moon-light, and by orchards and gardens from
      which the mingled scents of millions of blossoms were wafted to them,
      these voung people jested together and laughed and sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Thyrsis lay back and watched them and studied them. Their music was
      what is called "rag-time"&mdash;they had apparently found nothing better
      to do with their lives than to learn hundreds of verses and melodies, of
      which the subject-matter was the whims and moods of the half-tamed African
      race&mdash;their vanities and their barbarous impulses, and above all
      their hot and lustful passions. Song after song they poured forth, the
      substance of which was summed up in one line that Thyrsis happened to
      carry away with him&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Ah lubs you, mah honey, yes, Ah do!"
</pre>
    <p>
      It seemed to him such a curious and striking commentary upon the stage
      which leisure-class culture had reached, in the course of its reversion to
      savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10. Thyesis came home after three weeks, browned and refreshed, and
      ready to take up the struggle again. He came with the cup of his love and
      sympathy overflowing; eager to see Corydon, and to tell her his
      adventures, and to share with her his store of new hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her reclining on the piazza of the farm-house. The April buds
      were bursting upon the trees, and the odor of spring was in the air; also,
      the flush of health was stealing back into Corydon's cheeks. How beautiful
      she looked, and how soft and gentle was her caress, and what wistfulness
      and tenderness were in the smile with which she greeted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the baby also, tumultuous and excited. Thyrsis took him upon his
      knee, and while he fondled him and played with him, he told Corydon about
      his trip. But in a short while it became evident to him that she had
      something on her mind; and finally she sent the baby away to play, and
      began, "There is something I have to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is something very, very important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't know just how to begin," said Corydon. "I hope you are
      not going to be angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't imagine myself being angry just now," he replied; and then,
      struck by a sense of familiarity in this introduction, he asked, with a
      smile, "You haven't been seeing Harry Stuart, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon frowned at the words. "Don't speak of that!" she said, quickly. "I
      am not joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that she was agitated, and so he fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hesitated a long time about telling you," she went on. "But you must
      know. I am sure it's right to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means, dearest," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a long story," she said. "I must go back to my first operation." And
      then she began, and told him how she had found herself thinking of Mr.
      Harding, and of the strange vision she had had; she told of all her
      fevered excitements, and of her confession to him. When she finished she
      was trembling all over, and her face and throat were flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis sat for a while in silence, looking very grave. "I see," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you are not angry with me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not angry," he replied. "But tell me, what has been going on
      since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Corydon, "Mr. Harding has been coming here to see me. He saw
      I needed help, and he couldn't refuse it. It was&mdash;it was his duty to
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other. "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think he had an idea that the whole thing was a product of my
      sickness; and when I was well again, it would all be over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it, Corydon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat staring in front of her; her voice sank to a whisper. "No," she
      said. "It&mdash;it isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does he know that?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knows everything," she replied. "I don't need to tell him things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have you talked about it with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little," she said. "That is, you see, I had to explain to him&mdash;to
      apologize for what I had done in the hospital. I wanted him to know that I
      wouldn't have said anything to him, if I hadn't been so very ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I want you to understand," added Corydon, quickly-"you must not blame
      him. For he's the soul of honor, Thyrsis; and he can't help how he feels
      about me-any more than I can help it. You must know that, dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's been so good and so noble about it. He thinks so much of you,
      Thyrsis&mdash;he wouldn't do you wrong, not by a single word. He said that
      to me&mdash;-over and over again. He's frightened, you know, that either
      of us might do wrong. He's so sensitive-I think he takes things more
      seriously than anybody we've ever known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Thyrsis; and then, after a pause, he inquired, "But
      what's to come of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I don't know that there's anything to do, Thyrsis. What would there
      be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you going on being in love with him forever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't see how I can tell, Thyrsis. Would it do any harm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might grow on you," he said, with a slight smile. "It sometimes does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Harding said we ought never to speak of it again," said she. "And I
      guess he's right about that. He said that our lives would always be
      richer, because we had discovered each other's souls; that it would help
      us to grow into a nobler life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Thyrsis. "But it's a trifle disconcerting at first. I'll
      need a little time to get used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Harding is very anxious to know you better," remarked Corydon. "But
      you see, he's afraid of you, Thyrsis. You are so direct&mdash;you get to
      the point too quickly for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um&mdash;yes," said he. "I can imagine that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he thinks you distrust him," she went on&mdash;"just because he's
      orthodox. But he's really not half as backward as you think. His faith
      means a great deal to him. I only wish I had such a faith in my own life."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Thyrsis responded, "God knows, my dear, I wish you had."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11. The young clergyman came to call the next afternoon, and the
      three sat upon the lawn and talked. They talked about Florida, and then
      about Socialism&mdash;as was inevitable, after Thyrsis had described the
      population of the East Coast hotels. But he felt constrained and troubled&mdash;he
      did not know just how a man should conduct himself with his wife's lover;
      and so in the end he excused himself and strolled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back as Mr. Harding was leaving; and it seemed to him that the
      other's face wore a look of pain and distress. Also, at supper he noted
      that Corydon was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has gone wrong with your program?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Corydon answered, "Mr. Harding thinks he ought not to come any
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not come any more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says I don't need him now. And he thinks&mdash;he thinks it isn't
      right. He's afraid to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so a week passed, and the young clergyman was not seen again. Thyrsis
      noticed that his wife was silent a great deal; and that when she did talk,
      she talked about Mr. Harding. His heart ached to see her as she was, so
      pitifully weak and appealing. She was scarcely able to walk alone yet; and
      she complained also that her mind had been weakened by the frightful
      ordeal she had undergone. It exhausted her to do any thinking at all; and
      she seemed to have forgotten nearly all she knew&mdash;there were whole
      subjects upon which her mind appeared to be a blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he gave up trying to think about his book, and went about all day
      pondering this new problem. It was one of the laws of the marriage state
      that he must suffer whenever she suffered. It was never permitted to him
      to question the reality of any of her emotions; if they were real to her,
      they were real in the only sense that counted; and he must take them with
      the entire tragic seriousness that she took them, he must regard them as
      inevitable and fatal. For himself, he could change or suppress emotions&mdash;that
      ability was the most characteristic fact about him; but Corydon could not
      do it, and so he was not permitted to do it. That would be to manifest the
      "cold" and "stern" self, which was to Corydon an object of abhorrence and
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he went about all day, brooding over this trouble. He would come to
      Corydon and see her gazing across the valley with a melancholy look upon
      her features; he would see her, with her sweet face as if suffused with
      unshed tears. And what was he to do about it? Was he to rebuke her&mdash;however
      gently&mdash;and urge her to suppress this yearning? To do that would be
      to plunge her into abysses of grief. Or was he to come to her, and utter
      his own love to her, and draw her to him again? He knew that he could do
      that&mdash;he was conceited enough to believe that with his eloquence and
      his power of soul, he could have wiped Mr. Harding clean out of her
      thoughts in a few days. But then, when he had done it, he would have to go
      back to the task of revolutionizing the world's critical standards; and
      what would become of Corydon after that? What she needed, he told himself,
      was a love that was not a will o' the wisp and a fraud, but a love that
      was real and unceasing; she needed the love of a man, and not of an
      artist!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here were two young people who were in love with each other; and according
      to the specifications of the moral code, they had their minds made up to
      sublime renunciation. But then, Thyrsis had a moral code of his own, and
      in it renunciation was not the only law of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when he thought of losing Corydon, that he realized to the
      full how much he loved her. Then all their consecrations and their pledges
      would come back to him; he would hold her as the greatest human soul that
      he had ever met. But it was a strange paradox, that precisely the depth of
      his love for her made him willing to think of losing her. He loved her for
      herself, and not for anything she gave him; he wanted her to be happy, he
      wanted her to grow and achieve, and in order to see her do this he would
      make any sacrifice in the world. In how many hours of insight had it
      become clear to him that he himself could never make her happy&mdash;that
      he was not the man to be her husband! Now it seemed as if the time had
      come for him to prove that he meant what he had said&mdash;that he was
      willing to stand by his vision and to act upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So after one day of especial unhappiness, he made up his mind to a
      desperate resolve; and at night, when all the household was asleep, he
      went over to his lonely study and sat down with a pen in his hand, and
      summoned the spirit of Mr. Harding before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have concluded to write you a letter," he began. "You will find it a
      startling and unusual one. I can only beg you to believe that I have
      written it after much hesitation, and that it represents most earnest and
      prayerful thought upon my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since my return, I have become aware of the situation which has developed
      between yourself and my wife. Her welfare is dearer to me than anything
      else in the world; and after thinking it over, I concluded that her
      welfare required that I should explain to you the relationship which
      exists between us. It seems unlikely that you could know about it
      otherwise, for it is a very unusual relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose there is no need for me to tell you that Corydon is not happy.
      She never has been happy as my wife, and I fear that she never will be.
      She is by nature warm-hearted, craving affection and companionship. I, on
      the other hand, am by nature impersonal and self-absorbed&mdash;I am
      compelled by the exigencies of my work to be abstracted and indifferent to
      things about me. I perceived this before our marriage, but not clearly
      enough to save her; it has been her misfortune that I have loved her so
      dearly that I have been driven to attempt the impossible. I am
      continuually deceiving myself into the belief that I am succeeding&mdash;and
      I am continually deceiving Corydon in the same way. It has been our habit
      to talk things out between us frankly; but this is a truth from which we
      have shrunk instinctively. I have always seen it as the seed of what must
      grow to be a bitter tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The possibility that Corydon might come to love some other man was one
      that I had not thought of&mdash;it was very stupid of me, no doubt. But
      now it has happened; and I have worked over the problem with all the
      faculties I possess. A man who was worthy of Corydon's love would be very
      apt, under the circumstances, to feel that he must crush his impulses
      towards her. But when we were married, it was with the agreement that our
      marriage should be binding upon us only so long as it was for the highest
      spiritual welfare of both; and by that agreement it is necessary that we
      should stand at all times. My purpose in writing to you is to let you know
      that I have no claim upon Corydon which prohibits her from continuing her
      acquaintance with you; and that if in the course of time it should become
      clear that Corydon would be happier as your wife than as mine, I should
      regard it as my duty to step aside. Having said this, I feel that I have
      done my part. I leave the matter in your hands, with the fullest
      confidence in your sincerity and good faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis wrote this letter, and read it a couple of times. Then he decided
      to sleep over it; and the next morning he wakened, and read it again&mdash;with
      a shock of surprise. He found it a startling letter. It opened up vistas
      to his spirit; vistas of loneliness and grief&mdash;and then again, vistas
      of freedom and triumph. If he were to mail it, it would be irrevocable;
      and it would probably mean that he would lose Corydon. And <i>could</i> he
      make up his mind to lose her? His swift thoughts flew to their parting;
      there were tears in his eyes&mdash;his love came back to him, as it had
      when he thought she was dying. But then again, there came a thrill of
      exultation; the captive lion within him smelt the air of the jungle, and
      rattled his chains and roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout breakfast he was absent-minded and ill at ease; he bid Corydon
      a farewell which puzzled her by its tenderness, and then started to walk
      to Bellevue with the letter. Half way in, he stopped. No, he could not do
      it&mdash;it was a piece of madness; but then he started again&mdash;he <i>must</i>
      do it. He found himself pacing up and down before the post office, where
      for nearly an hour he struggled to screw his courage to the
      sticking-point. Once he started away, having made up his mind that he
      would take another day to think the matter over; but after he had walked
      half a mile or so, he changed his mind and strode back, and dropped the
      letter in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a pang smote him. It was done! All the way as he walked home he
      had to fight with an impulse to go back, and persuade the postmaster to
      return the letter to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12. Thyrsis figured that the fatal document would reach Mr. Harding
      that afternoon; and the next morning in his anxiety he walked a mile or
      two to meet the mail-carrier on his way. Sure enough, there was a reply
      from the clergyman. He tore it open and read it swiftly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I received your letter, and I hasten to answer. I cannot tell you the
      distress of mind which it has caused me. There has been a most dreadful
      misundertanding, and I can only hope that it has not gone too far to be
      corrected. I beg you to believe me that there has been nothing between
      your wife and myself that could justify the inference you have drawn. Your
      wife was in terrible distress of spirit, and I visited her and tried to
      comfort her&mdash;such is my duty as a clergyman, as I conceive it. I did
      nothing but what a clergyman should properly do, and you have totally
      misunderstood me, and also your wife, who is the most innocent and gentle
      and trusting of souls. She is utterly devoted to you, and the idea that
      the help I have tried to give her should be the occasion of any
      misunderstanding between you is dreadful for me to contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must implore you to believe this, and dismiss these cruel suspicions
      from your mind. If I were to be the cause of breaking up your home, and
      wrecking Corydon's life, it would be more than I could bear. I have a most
      profound belief in the sanctity of the institution of marriage, and not
      for anything in the world would I have been led to do, or even to
      contemplate in my own thoughts, anything which would trespass upon its
      obligations. I repeat to you with all the earnestness of which I am
      capable that your idea is without basis, and I beg you to banish it from
      your mind. You may rely upon it that I will not see your wife again, under
      any circumstances imaginable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis read this, and then stared before him with knitted brows. "Why,
      what's the matter with the man?" he said to himself. And then he read the
      letter over again, weighing its every phrase. "Did he think my letter was
      sarcasm?" he wondered. "Did he think I was angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his study and got the rough draft of his own letter, and reread
      and pondered it. No, he concluded, it was not possible that Mr. Harding
      had thought he was angry. "He's trying to dodge!" he exclaimed. "He can't
      bring himself to face the thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again, he wondered. Could it be that the man was right; could it
      be that Corydon had misunderstood him and his attitude? Or had he perhaps
      experienced a reaction, and was now trying to deny his feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      For several hours Thyrsis pondered the problem; and then he went and sat
      by her, as she was reading on the piazza. "You haven't heard anything more
      from Mr. Harding, have you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," said Corydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you suppose he intends to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't know," she said. "I don't think he means to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's afraid to trust himself, Thyrsis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think he really cares for you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, how can you be sure?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which Corydon smiled. "A woman has ways of knowing about such things,"
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd tell me about it," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a little thought, she shook her head. "Maybe some day, but not
      now. It wouldn't be fair to him. It isn't going any further, and that's
      enough for you to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be unhappy, isn't he?" said Thyrsis, artfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered, "he's unhappy, I'm sure. He takes things very
      seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis paused a moment. "Did he tell you that he loved you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Corydon. "He&mdash;he wouldn't have permitted himself to do
      that. That would have been wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then&mdash;what did he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked at me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he went off the other day&mdash;did he know how you still felt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Thyrsis; why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you might have been deceiving yourself."'
    </p>
    <p>
      At which she smiled and replied, "I wouldn't have bothered to tell you in
      that case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13. So Thyrsis strolled away, and after duly considering the matter,
      he sat himself down to compose another letter to the young clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Harding:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read your note with a great deal of perplexity. It is evident to me
      that I have not made the situation clear to you; you probably do not find
      it easy to realize the frankness which Corydon and I maintain in our
      relationship. I must tell you at the outset that she has narrated to me
      what has passed between you, and so I am not dealing with 'cruel
      suspicions', but with facts. Can I not persuade you to do the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is difficult for me to be sure just what is in your mind. But for one
      thing, let me make certain that you are not trying to read anything
      between the lines of what I write you. Please understand I am not angry,
      or jealous, or suspicious; also, I am not unhappy&mdash;at least not so
      unhappy but that I can stand it. I have stood a good deal of unhappiness
      in my life, and Corydon has also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell me about your attitude towards my wife. Of course it may be that
      as you come to look back upon what has passed between you, it seems to you
      that your feeling for her was not deep and permanent, and that you would
      prefer not to continue your acquaintance with her. That would be your
      right&mdash;you have not pledged yourself in any way. All that I desire
      is, that in considering the state of your feelings, you should deal with
      them, and not with any duty which you may imagine you owe to <i>me</i>. I
      have no claim in the matter, and any that I might have, I forego.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The crux of the whole difficulty I imagine must lie in what you say about
      your 'profound belief in the sanctity of the institution of marriage'.
      That is, of course, a large question to attempt to discuss in a letter. I
      can only say that I once had such a belief, and that as a result of my
      studies I have it no longer. I see the institution of marriage as a
      product of a certain phase of the economic development of the race, which
      phase is rapidly passing, if it be not already past. And the institution
      to me seems to share in the evils of the economic phase; indeed I am
      accustomed, when invited to discuss the institution of marriage, to insist
      upon discussing what actually exists&mdash;which is the institution of
      marriage-plus-prostitution.
    </p>

      "Our economic system affords to certain small classes of men&mdash;to
      capitalists, to merchants, to lawyers, to clergymen&mdash;opportunities of
      comfort and dignity and knowledge and health and virtue. But to certain
      other classes, and far larger classes-to miners, to steel-workers, to
      garment-makers&mdash;it deals out misery and squalor and ignorance and
      disease and vice. And in the case of women it does exactly the same; to
      some it gives a sheltered home, with comfort and beauty and peace; while
      to others it gives a life of loneliness and sterility, and to others a
      life of domestic slavery, and to yet others only the horrors of the
      brothel. And when you come to investigate, you find that the difference is
      everywhere one of economic advantage. The merchant, the lawyer, the
      clergyman, has education and privilege, he can wait and make his terms;
      but the miner, the steel-worker, the sweat-shop-toiler, has to sell his
      labor for what will keep him alive that day. And in the same way with
      women&mdash;some can acquire accomplishments, virtues, charms; and when it
      comes to giving their love, they can secure the life-contract which we
      call marriage. But the daughter of the slums has no opportunity to acquire
      such accomplishments and virtues and charms, and often she cannot hold out
      for such a bargain&mdash;she sells her love for the food and shelter that
      she needs to keep her alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will seem radical doctrine to you, I suppose; I have noticed that
      you take our institutions at their face-value, and do not ask how much in
      them may be sham. But it seems to me there is no need to go into that
      matter here, for no trespass upon the marriage obligation is proposed. The
      conventions undoubtedly give me the right to be outraged because my wife
      is in love with another man; I can denounce him, and humiliate her. But if
      I am willing to forego this right, if I do not care to play Othello to her
      Desdemona, what then? Who can claim to be injured by my renunciation?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I know it is said that marriages are made in Heaven, and that
      what God hath joined together, no man may put asunder. But it is difficult
      for me to imagine that an intelligent man would take this attitude at the
      present day. If I were dead, you would surely recognize that Corydon might
      remarry; you would recognize it, I presume, if I were hopelessly insane,
      or degenerate. What if I were in the habit of getting drunk and
      maltreating her&mdash;would you claim that she was condemned to suffer
      this for life? Or suppose that I were found to be physically impotent? And
      can you not recognize the fact that there might be impotence of an
      intellectual and spiritual sort, which could leave a woman quite as
      unhappy, and make her life quite as barren and futile?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us suppose, for the sake of the argument, that I have stated
      correctly the facts between Corydon and myself; that there exists between
      us a fundamental difference in temperament, which makes it certain that,
      however much we might respect and admire, and even love each other, we
      could never either of us be happy as man and wife; and suppose that
      Corydon were to meet some other man, with whom she could live
      harmoniously; and that she loved him sincerely, and he loved her; and that
      I were to recognize this, and be willing that she should leave me&mdash;do
      you mean that you would maintain that such a course was wrong? And if it
      were, with whom would the blame be? With her, because she did not condemn
      herself to a lifetime of failure? Or with me, because I did not desire her
      to do this&mdash;because I did not wish to waste my life-force in trying
      to content a discontented woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might add that I have said nothing to Corydon about having written to
      you; she has no idea that I have thought of such a thing, and she would be
      horrified at the suggestion. I have taken the responsibility of doing it,
      realizing that there was no other way in which you could be made
      acquainted with the true situation. There is much more that I could say
      about all this, but it seems a waste of time to write it. Can we not meet
      sometime, and get at each other's point of view? I am going to be in town
      the day after to-morrow, and unless I hear from you to the contrary, I
      will drop in to see you some time in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 14. Thyrsis read this letter over two or three times; and then,
      resisting the impulse to elaborate his exposition of the economic bases of
      the marriage institution, he took it in to town and mailed it. He waited
      eagerly for a reply the next day; but no reply came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after that, he walked down to town as he had agreed to, and
      called at Mr. Harding's home. The door was opened by his housekeeper,
      Delia Gordon's aunt. "Is Mr. Harding in?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone up to the city," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the city," said Thyrsis. "When did he go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He left this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when will he be back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. He left rather suddenly, and he didn't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Thyrsis. "Tell him I called, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went home and mailed another note to Mr. Harding, asking him to
      make an appointment for a meeting; after which he waited for three or four
      days&mdash;but still there came no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard anything more from Mr. Harding?" he asked of Corydon,
      finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear," she answered. "I don't expect to hear." But he saw that she
      was nervous and <i>distrait</i>; and he knew by her unwonted interest in
      the mail that she was all the time hoping to get some word from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to handling any affair with Corydon, Thyrsis was a poor
      diplomatist. He would tell himself that this or that should be kept from
      her for the present; but the secrecy always irked him&mdash;his impulse
      was to talk things out with her, to go hand in hand with her to face the
      facts of their life. So now, in this case; one afternoon he settled her
      comfortably in a hammock, and sat beside her and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon," he said, "I've something I want to tell you. I've been having a
      correspondence with Mr. Harding."
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, and stared at him wildly. "What do you mean?" she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wrote him two letters," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to explain about us," he said; and then he told her what he had
      put in the first letter, and read Mr. Harding's reply, which he had in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you make of it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what your answer was!" cried Corydon, quickly; and so he began to
      outline his second letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not let him get very far. "You wrote him that way about
      marriage!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Thyrsis! He'll be perfectly horrified!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Thyrsis! Don't you understand? He's a clergyman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know; but it's the truth&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know anything about people at all!" she cried. "Can't you
      realize? He doesn't reason about things like you; you can't appeal to him
      in that way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what was I to do&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll never see him again!" exclaimed Corydon, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't be any worse than it was before, will it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she rushed on, in her agitation. "Did you tell him that I had
      no idea what you were doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I told him that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you make it perfectly clear to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried to, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what you said! Tell me the rest of the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he recited it, as well as he could, while she listened, breathless
      with dismay. "How could you!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she read over Mr. Harding's letter once more. "You see," she said;
      "he was simply dazed. He didn't know what to say, he didn't know what to
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll get over it in time. He had to know, somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>why</i> did he have to know? Why couldn't things have stayed as
      they were?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my dear, you are in love with the man, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want to marry him, Thyrsis! I don't&mdash;I don't love him
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have come to it in the course of time," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see that he'd have to give up being a clergyman?" she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's been done before," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;see it from his point of view! Think of the scandal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think much about scandals," Thyrsis answered. "That part could be
      arranged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do the laws give people divorces in that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our divorce laws are relics of feudalism," he answered. "One does not
      take them seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you get around them, Thyrsis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You simply have to admit whatever offense they require."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis! Think how that would seem to Mr. Harding!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he answered, "if I knew that a divorce was necessary to your
      happiness, I would take upon myself whatever disgrace was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon sat gazing at him. "Is it so easy to give me up?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't easy at all, my dear," he answered. "It was a fight that I
      fought out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you decided that you could do it!" she exclaimed; and that, he found,
      was the aspect of the matter that stayed with her in the end. It seemed a
      poor sort of compliment he had paid her; and how could he make real to her
      the pangs the decision had cost him? He expected her to take that for
      granted&mdash;in all these years, had he not been able to convince her of
      his love?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old story between them, he reflected; he was always being
      called upon to express his feelings, and always reluctant to attempt it.
      Just now she wanted him to enter upon an eloquent exposition of how he had
      suffered and hesitated before he mailed the letter; and she would hang
      upon his words, and drink them in greedily&mdash;and of course, the more
      convincing he made them, the more she would love <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could never leave him, she insisted&mdash;the idea of giving him up
      was madness. She had not meant any such thing by falling in love with Mr.
      Harding. Why must he be so elemental, so brutally direct? He was like some
      clumsy animal, blundering about in the garden where she kept her
      sentimental plants. He frightened her, as he had frightened Mr. Harding.
      She stood appalled at this thing which he had done; the truth being that
      his action had sprung from a certain deep conviction in him, which he
      never found courage to utter to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 15. Thyrsis pledged his word that he would write no more to Mr.
      Harding; and so they settled down to wait for a reply. But a couple more
      days passed, and still there came nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corydon was restless and impatient. "What <i>can</i> he be doing?" she
      exclaimed. Finally it chanced that Thyrsis had to go to Bellevue upon some
      errand; and so the two drove into town together, and came upon the
      solution of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the street they met Mr. Jennings, the high-school principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning," said he. "A fine day." And then, "Have you heard the news
      about Harding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news?" asked Thyrsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's resigned his pastorate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis stared at the man, dazed; he felt Corydon beside him give a start.
      "Resigned his pastorate!" she echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other, "just so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We none of us know. We're at our wits' end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;how did you hear it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm one of the trustees of the church, and his letter was read last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis could not find a word to utter. He sat staring at the man in
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he say?" cried Corydon, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said that for some time he had been dissatisfied with his work, and
      felt the need of more study and reflection. It quite took our breath away,
      for nobody'd had the least idea that anything was wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's he going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently he's going abroad," was the answer&mdash;"at least he ordered
      his mail to be forwarded to an address in Switzerland. And that's all we
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a few remarks about the spiritual ferment in the churches, the
      worthy high-school principal went on his way, and left Corydon and Thyrsis
      in the middle of the street. For a minute or two they sat staring before
      them as if in a trance; and then suddenly from Thyrsis' lips there burst a
      peal of wild laughter. "By the Lord God, he ran away from it!" he cried;
      and he seized Corydon by the arm and cried again, "He ran away from it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thyrsis!" exclaimed the other. "Don't laugh about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't laugh!" he gasped; and again the convulsion of hilarity swept over
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corydon turned upon him swiftly. "No!" she cried. "Stop! It's no
      joke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was staring at him, her eyes wide with consternation and dismay.
      "Think!" she exclaimed. "He's given up his career!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "so it seems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awful!" she cried. "Oh, how <i>could</i> he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the way the news affected her, and he made an effort to control
      himself. "The man simply couldn't face it," he said. "He didn't dare to
      trust himself. He ran."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis!" she exclaimed. "I can't believe it! He's given up his whole
      life-work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's fled like Joseph," said Thyrsis&mdash;"leaving his cloak in the
      hands of the temptress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, the strain proving too much for him, he began to laugh again.
      Becoming aware of the stares of some people on the street, he started up
      the horse, and drove on into the country, where he could be alone, and
      could give unrestrained expression to the emotions that possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He imagined the dismay and perplexity of the unhappy clergyman, with his
      belief in the sacred institution of marriage&mdash;and with the vision of
      Corydon pursuing him all day, and haunting his dreams at night. He
      imagined him trying to face the interview with the husband&mdash;with the
      terrible, conventionless husband, whose arguments could not be answered.
      "He simply couldn't face me! He went the very morning I was coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So he would laugh again; he would laugh until he was so weak that he had
      to lie back in his seat. "I can't believe that it's true!" he exclaimed.
      "My dear, I think it's the funniest thing that ever happened since the
      world began!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thyrsis!" she protested. "Think what we've done to him! The man's
      life is wrecked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said he. "It's the best thing that could have happened to him.
      He might have gone on preaching sermons all his life&mdash;but now he's
      got some ideas to work out. He'll have time to read books, and to think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he must be suffering so!" exclaimed Corydon, who could not forget her
      love, even in the presence of his ribaldry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He needs to suffer," Thyrsis replied. "He may meet some of the radicals
      over there, and come back with a new point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corydon shook her head. "You don't know him," she said. "He couldn't
      possibly change. I don't think I'll ever hear from him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis looked at her and saw that there were tears in her eyes. He put
      his hand upon hers. "We'll have to worry through for a while longer,
      dear," he said. "Never mind&mdash;we'll manage to make out somehow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 16. They drove home; and all through supper they talked about this
      breathless event. Afterwards they sat in the twilight, upon the porch, and
      threshed it out in its every aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corydon," said he, "I don't believe you really loved him as much as you
      thought. Did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared before her without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you have loved him for long?" he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pondered over this. "I don't think one could love a man always," she
      answered, "unless he had a mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      At which he pondered in turn. "Then it was too bad to drive him away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said she. "That's what I couldn't make clear to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still, we had to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> may have," she said. "I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrsis looked, and saw that she was smiling through her tears. He took
      her hand in his. "We'll see each other through, dear," he said. "We'll
      have to wait until the world grows up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an answering pressure of her hand. "Thyrsis," she said, "you must
      promise me that you will never do anything dreadful like that again. You
      must understand me; I might think that I was in love, but it would never
      be real&mdash;truly it wouldn't. No man could ever mean to me what you
      mean&mdash;I know that! And I couldn't give you up&mdash;you must never
      let yourself think of such a thing! I couldn't give you up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So there came to Thyrsis one of those bursts of tenderness that she knew
      so well. He put his arms about her and kissed her with fervor; but even
      while he spoke with her, and gave her the love she desired, there was
      something in him that sank back and moaned with despair. So the captive
      sinks and moans when he finds that his break for freedom has led only to
      the tightening of his chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>They stood for the last time before the cabin, bidding farewell to the
      little glen and all its memories.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are lines in the poem for everything," she said. "Even for that!"
      And she quoted&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "He hearkens not! light comer, he is flown!"
</pre>
    <p>
      He laughed. "I can do better yet," he said&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "Alack, for Corydon no rival now!"
</pre>
    <p>
      There was a pause. "That was five years," she mused. "And there were five
      more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will mean another book," he said. "To tell about the new work; and how
      Thyrsis became a social lion; and how, like Icarus, he flew too high and
      melted his wings. And then, 'The Exploiters,' the book of his vengeance!
      And then Corydon&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do not forget Corydon," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How he watched her dying before his eyes, and how he prayed for months
      for courage to kill her, and could not, but ran away. And then&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will make a long story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a long story. 'Love's Deliverance,' let us call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will smile at that. It sounds like Reno, Nevada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Love's Deliverance,' even so," he said. "To tell how Thyrsis went out
      into the wilderness and found himself; and of the new love that came to
      Corydon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a Bible for lovers," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he replied, and smiled-"with a book of Chronicles, and a book of
      Proverbs, and a book of Psalms, and a book of Revelations&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And several books of Epistles," she interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tablets in the temple are cracked," he said, "and the fortresses of
      privilege are crumbling. When the Revolution is here&mdash;when there are
      no longer priests nor judges nor class-taboos&mdash;then out of the hunger
      of our own hearts we shall have to shape our sex-ideals, and organize our
      new aristocracies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will call it a book of 'free love'," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which he answered, gravely: <i>"Let us redeem our great words from base
      uses. Let that no longer call itself Love, which knows that it is not
      free!"</i>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
